<h4>P4 Outdoor Adventure Learning (OAL) Cohort Camp (6 Mar to 8 Mar 2025)</h4>
<p>The P4 OAL Cohort Camp will be conducted at <strong>Ministry of Education Changi Coast Outdoor Adventure Learning Centre</strong> (CCOALC).
Using outdoors as the ‘classroom’ for learning and development, this camp
offers our students a unique opportunity to work together in teams and
to develop problem-solving skills to overcome various outdoor challenges.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The theme of the camp is A Journey of Growth and Discovery. We aim to
inspire our students to approach their learning journey with curiosity
and enthusiasm as they begin this path of exploration and discovery. By
embracing a growth mindset, they will develop the ability to reframe challenges
and adopt new perspectives, seeing obstacles as opportunities for growth
and learning. In addition, they will recognise the importance of teamwork,
understanding that collaboration enhances their chances of achieving success.</p>
