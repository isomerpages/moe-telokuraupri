<p>The school will be commemorating International Friendship Day. The theme

deepening their understanding of ASEAN during the assembly programme, students
will also be engaged in hands-on cultural activities during recess, celebrating
the vibrance and diversity in Singapore and neighbouring countries. Students
are encouraged to <u>wear international costumes with white school shoes on 7 April 2025</u>.
If they do not have any international costume, they may come to school

<h4><strong>Chinese Drama Excursion (10 April 2025)</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>As part of our enrichment programme, our school is organising a Chinese
drama appreciation excursion to expose our Primary 3 students and selected
Primary 4 students to Chinese performing arts as well as to promote greater
interest in the learning of Chinese language. Our students will be watching
the performance entitled ‘Bao Xiao Long Zhua Zei Ji’ (包小龙捉贼记) by the Singapore
Hokkien Huay Kuan Arts and Cultural Troupe.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The performance was thoughtfully chosen for its lively and entertaining
presentation. During the performance, the cast of the performance will
engage the audience to find out the identity of the thief in the show.
We hope that this experience will enhance our students' interest in learning
the Chinese language and foster a deeper appreciation of its rich culture.</p>
