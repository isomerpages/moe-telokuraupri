<h4>P4 and P5 Student Leaders’ VIA - World Aquatics Learning Journey &amp; Dance of the Nation Programme (16 July 2025)</h4>
<p>Earlier this year, our Primary 4 and 5 student leaders embarked on the
Serve to Lead Programme—an initiative supported by SportSG. Building on
this experience, they will participate in the Dance of the Nation programme,
where they will be trained to lead and motivate others in a lively and
engaging workout. This opportunity allows our student leaders to inspire
a shared vision and enable others to act, empowering them to lead with
empathy and purpose.</p>
<p>To continue building on the relationships forged with seniors from the
Active Ageing Centres, the student leaders will also participate in a World
Aquatics Learning Journey. They will reunite with the seniors and lead
them in the Dance of the Nation workout. This meaningful experience highlights
the value of sustained community engagement and reinforces The Leadership
Challenge (TLC) practice</p>
<p>of encouraging the heart—as students uplift and energise others through
movement and shared joy. We look forward to seeing our student leaders
rise to the occasion as they lead with courage, kindness, and conviction.</p>

Theatre — Singapore’s longest-running Tamil drama festival.</p>
<p>Thisaivegam continues to celebrate original short Tamil plays, showcasing
the vibrant talent within Singapore’s theatre community. This year’s festival
holds special significance as it embraces the theme of Singapore’s National

our nation’s rich multicultural spirit. Each play promises a unique blend
of culture, creativity, and patriotism on one stage.</p>
<p>Our students will attend the 3.30 p.m. show at Umar Pulavar Tamil Language
Centre Auditorium, featuring the following plays:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Education is the Goal, not just Grades (கல்வியே குறி, மதிப்பெண்கள் அல்ல)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vote: Difference and Indifference (வாக்கு வித்திோசம்)</p>

<li>
<p>Udayasuriyan (உதே சூரிேன்)</p>
</li>
<li>

with and complement one another.</p>

will be an assembly programme, quizzes, reflection and recess activities
that strengthen our social cohesion and ensure that our multicultural tapestry
remains strong and unified, exemplifying the strength and beauty of our
shared heritage and commitment to harmony. Students are encouraged to come
