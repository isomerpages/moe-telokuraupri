<h4>TKPS Yearbook 2025</h4>
<p>The third edition of the TKPS Yearbook captures the spirit of empowerment
and curiosity that defines our school community. With the theme <em>Exploring Possibilities; Empowering People</em>,
this issue celebrates the growth, resilience and creativity of our students
and staff as we continue to learn, lead and inspire one another.
<br>
<br>Slated for release in January 2026, this yearbook serves as a reflection
of our shared experiences, the moments that shaped us and the possibilities
that lie ahead when we empower one another to dream and achieve. Every
family will receive a copy of this edition.
<br>
<br>Our 2025 Primary 6 students will collect theirs on the day of their PSLE
results release. Our heartfelt thanks go to all students, parents and staff
for being part of this meaningful journey and for making TKPS a community
where everyone is inspired to explore, grow and shine together.</p>
