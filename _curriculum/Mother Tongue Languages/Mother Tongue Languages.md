### **Mother Tongue Languages**
#### **Vision**
Every Child An Engaged Mother Tongue Language Learner

#### **Mission**
To cultivate effective and confident communicators in Mother Tongue Language with a passion for Mother Tongue culture.

#### **Key Programmes**
##### **Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Fortnight**
This annual programme provides opportunities to learn more about their MTL and its culture. During MTL Fortnight, students are exposed to a variety of activities to enable them to learn and use MTL beyond the classroom. These activities include performing arts such as drama, cross talk, and learning journeys, as well as introductions to facets of Chinese, Malay and Indian culture.

##### **Learning Journeys**
Learning goes beyond the classrooms. Learning journeys are organised to expose our students to their ethnic cultures as well as to promote greater interest in the learning of Mother Tongue languages. These include cultural and drama appreciation excursions.

##### **Reading Programme**
Developing an effective reading program is vital to teaching literacy from an early age. Our reading programme aims to help our students develop the habit of reading for pleasure by exposing them to a variety of storybooks in Mother Tongue. Activities are designed to encourage students to review and talk about the books that they have read.

##### **Festive Celebrations**
We celebrate Chinese New Year, Hari Raya Puasa and Deepavali as a school community. We encourage our students to celebrate their own traditions while promoting the understanding and respect of different cultures amongst our students.

##### **Parent Workshops**
We are firm believers that parents play a vital role in the development and education of children. Parent Workshops are organised for parents to gain a deeper understanding of what their child is learning during MTL lessons and how they can work hand in hand with the school to better support the learning of their child.
