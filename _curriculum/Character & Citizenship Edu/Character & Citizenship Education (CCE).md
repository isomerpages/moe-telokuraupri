##### **National Education Learning Journeys (NE LJ)**
National Education Learning Journeys are authentic learning experiences that enable students to explore their personal and collective identity by engaging with the people, perspectives and places of Singapore. One example is the National Education Show.

##### **Field-Based Learning (FbL)**
Field-Based Learning allows the students to contextualise their learning experience in an authentic real-world setting. Students would also be able to conduct hands-on exploration in a focused area of study, thus being engaged in multi-sensory modes. As part of engaging students’ interest in inquiry, field-based learning would also motivate and sustain their interest in the subject matter as they would learn to explore, construct new knowledge and make connections to the topic being studied.

##### **Project Work**
Project Work provides students with opportunities to highlight the importance to work as a team, think creatively and critically, and communicate effectively. It is a form of formative assessment that would best reflect students’ ability to translate and transfer key knowledge and skills in a new context.

##### **The Big Reveal**
The Big Reveal is a platform that allows the students to showcase the projects that they have created. It is also an opportunity for them to learn from one another in an engaging and fun environment.

##### **NE Commemorative Days**
Four NE Commemorative Days are identified as defining moments in Singapore's history. They are Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day.
  
We focus on the design of experiences that strengthen our students’ citizenship dispositions to inspire them to take collective ownership of their future as a nation. We aim to instill active citizenry in students to have a global outlook yet a sense of rootedness to Singapore.

##### **Roll of Honour (ROH) & Catch Them Doing Right (CTDR)**
ROH focuses on the school’s 6 core values of Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Harmony. Every term, two values will be focused on and each class will nominate two students who exemplify these values. Different students are nominated each term so as to recognize more students for their efforts in displaying these values.

##### **Values-in-Action (VIA)**

VIA provide learning experiences that support students’ development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. VIA fosters student ownership over how they contribute to the community. As part of VIA, students reflect on their experience, the values they have put into practice, and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully.

##### **CCE Ambassadors Programme**
The CCE Ambassadors Programme is a structured leadership programme that strengthens values and builds competencies in selected student leaders who will serve as role models for their peers. They will learn to:
*   take the initiative to promote school values,      
*   foster a sense of belonging and responsibility to the school, community and nation, and
*   be actively involved in facilitating CCE activities and core events to create a vibrant and meaningful experience for the school population

##### **International Students (IS) Programme**
Schools are important touch points to ensure that our students are socialised to diversity, and are able to mix well with other nationalities and cultures. The IS programme aims to help newcomers adapt to the Singaporean way of life, through better understanding of local cultures and social norms. It also seeks to facilitate the formation of friendships and shared experiences among local and international students.
