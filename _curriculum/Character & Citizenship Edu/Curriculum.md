### **Curriculum**
#### **CCE (Form Teacher Guidance Period) Lessons**
**Form Teacher Guidance Period**

As form teachers play a central role in shaping the development of their young charges, the Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) has been introduced in all primary schools since 2012. The allocated one period per week carves out time for more quality teacher-student interaction, to build supportive peer relationships, and allows teachers to equip students with social and emotional competencies.

In Telok Kurau Primary School, topics related to the six CCE content areas are explored and discussed in a developmentally appropriate manner during the FTGP lessons. These topics are:

* Cyber Wellness
* Education and Career Guidance
* Family Education
* Mental Health
* National Education
* Sexuality Education (at Primary 5 & 6)

Curriculum time is also set aside within FTGP lessons for the four NE Commemorative Days â€“ Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day, and National Day. These lessons help to create holistic learning experiences and instill a sense of belonging among the students.
