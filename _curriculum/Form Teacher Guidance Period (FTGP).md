### **Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)**
###### **Form Teacher Guidance Period**
As form teachers play a central role in shaping the development of their young charges, the Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) has been introduced in all primary schools since 2012. The allocated one period per week carves out time for more quality teacher-student interaction, and allows teachers to equip students with social and emotional competencies.

In Telok Kurau Primary School, lessons on the following topics are incorporated in FTGP to reinforce social and emotional competencies, as well as core values. These topics are:

*   Cyber Wellness
*   Social Skills
*   Peer Support
*   Relationship (Family and friends)
*   Education Career Guidance

Through interactive activities during FTGP and 1 to 1 interaction time, form teachers strengthen their relationship with the students. Students are also encouraged to pen down their thoughts and reflection in journals to consolidate their learning at the end of these lessons.
