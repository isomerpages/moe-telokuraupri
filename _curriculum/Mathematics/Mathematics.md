<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>Every Student a Creative Problem Solver with a Lifelong Interest in Mathematics</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>To nurture our students to become effective problem solvers with a passion
for Mathematics</p>
<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>Programmes to ENRICH learning</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Learning of logic and reasoning games (Online)</strong>
</p>
<p>The Games Room features a variety of games that promotes the learning
of Mathematics, Science and English. These games promote reasoning and
logical thinking. Due to safe management measures taken into consideration,
students will learn some of these games via the Student Learning Space
(SLS) instead.</p>
<p>They will be taught the rules and fundamental strategies associated with
the games. Some of the games include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Sudoku</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Othello (also known as Reversi)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spokes puzzle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Magic Squares</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rubik’s Cube</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connect 4</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Real life application of Mathematics concepts through ICT-based learning</strong>
</p>
<p>Learning of Mathematics goes beyond the textbooks. At TKPS, students are
given opportunities to see how mathematical concepts are applied in the
real world.</p>
<p>At Primary 4, students demonstrate apply their learning on graphs to present
data based on a given scenario using Microsoft Excel.</p>
<p>At Primary 5, students use Microsoft Excel formula to find out the average
of a set of items based on real-life scenarios.</p>
<h5><strong>Programmes to SUPPORT learning</strong></h5>
<p><strong>P1 &amp; P2 Learning Support for Mathematics (P1/P2 LSM)</strong>
</p>
<p>Learning support is provided for Primary 1 (P1) students who need additional
help with Mathematics. These P1 students will be identified through screening
that will be conducted upon school entry. The lessons are conducted by
trained teachers and focus on developing numeracy skills. The class size
is kept small at about 8 students.</p>
<p><strong>ICAN Programme (P3 &amp; P4)</strong>
</p>
<p>The ICAN (Improve Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy) programme with
MOE support lower progress students from Primary 3 to Primary 6 by the
use of intervention strategies and models guided by research.</p>
<h5><strong>Programmes to ENHANCE learning</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Mathematics Competitions</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are provided opportunities to participate and register for several
Mathematics Competitions. Competitions include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>SMOPS (for Pri 6)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NUS High NMOS (for Pri 5)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SASMO (for Pri 4 to Pri 6)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>More information will be provided to students nearer the registration.</p>
<p><strong>Excellence 2000 (E2K) Mathematics Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The school offers the E2K Mathematics Programme Singapore to Primary 5
students. It is a Mathematics enrichment programme for students who demonstrate
interest and ability in Mathematics. It aims to develop in students’ mathematical
reasoning skills and deepen their conceptual understanding through an inquiry
approach.</p>
<p>Students will have opportunities to work independently or collaborate
with their peers and engage in mathematical thinking through resources
such as puzzles, games and mathematical explorations. The rich learning
experiences offered serve to help students to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions of a mathematician.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gain important 21st century competencies such as critical thinking, inventive
thinking and effective communication skills.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Teachers who have been trained in the E2K pedagogy run the programme.
The programme will take place over 15 weeks in Semester 1. Each session
will be 90 min.</p>
