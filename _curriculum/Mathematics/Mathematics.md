<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>Every Student a Creative Problem Solver with a Lifelong Interest in Mathematics</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>To nurture our students to become effective problem solvers with a passion
for Mathematics</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong><u>Key Programmes</u></strong></h4>
<h4><strong>Programmes to SUPPORT learning</strong></h4>
<p><strong>P1 to P3 Learning Support for Mathematics (P1 to P3 LSM)</strong>
</p>
<p>The Learning Support in Mathematics (LSM) programme offers targeted support
to P1 to P3 students, fostering a strong foundation in numeracy skills
through early intervention. With the guidance of trained LSM teachers,
students develop essential mathematical knowledge, skills, and disposition.</p>
<p>In small groups, students receive tailored support to bridge learning
gaps and achieve numeracy skills required at their respective levels. Through
engaging hands-on learning experiences, students grow in confidence and
interest in the learning of Mathematics.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>ICAN Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The ICAN (Improve Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy) programme support
low progress students from all levels using intervention strategies and
models guided by research.</p>
<h4><strong>Programmes to ENHANCE learning</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Mathematics Competitions</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are provided opportunities to participate and register for several
Mathematics Competitions. Competitions include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>SMOPS (for P6)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NUS High NMOS (for P5)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SASMO (for P4 to P6)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>More information will be provided to students nearer the registration.

</p>
<p><strong>Excellence 2000 (E2K) Mathematics Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The school offers the E2K Mathematics Programme Singapore to P4 and P5
students. It is a Mathematics enrichment programme for students who demonstrate
interest and ability in Mathematics. It aims to develop in studentsâ€™ mathematical
reasoning skills and deepen their conceptual understanding through an inquiry
approach.</p>
<p>Students will have opportunities to work independently or collaborate
with their peers and engage in mathematical thinking through resources
such as puzzles, games and mathematical explorations. The rich learning
experiences offered serve to help students to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions of a mathematician.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gain important 21st century competencies such as critical thinking, inventive
thinking and effective communication skills.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Teachers who have been trained in the E2K pedagogy run the programme.
The programme will take place over 15 weeks in Semester 1.</p>
