### **Programme for Active Learning (PAL)**
The Programme for Active Learning (PAL) started in 2009 as one of the recommendations from the Primary Education Review and Implementation (PERI) committee to provide a greater emphasis on non-academic programmes for all Primary 1 and 2 students.  
  
Your child will have the opportunity during curriculum time to try out activities in sports and outdoor education, as well as in performing and visual arts. All primary schools offer PAL to their Primary 1 and Primary 2 students.  
  
In Telok Kurau Primary School, we build upon the strengths of what is taught in the existing curricula for Physical Education (PE), Art and Music, with avenues for students to develop their values and social emotional competencies.  
  
We also use a thematic approach to deliver the content and strive to make the PAL experience fun and enjoyable for the students. Our existing theme for PAL - **Worlds of Imagination**, puts the students in the role of explorers. To stimulate their imagination and creativity, we tell them that they are on a flying ship which takes them to different places around the world. They will learn about the customs, cultures and practices of the land and the people.
