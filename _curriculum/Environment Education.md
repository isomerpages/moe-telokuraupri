Go Green aims to promote quality environmental education through awareness, attitude and action. Our programmes and activities provide the opportunity for staff and students to play their part in saving Mother Earth. Some of them include the 3Rs, Festival of Biodiversity, Earth Day, Dengue Prevention Launch Campaign and Eco-brick.

##### **Go Green Ambassadors**
Being stewards of the environment, the main objective of the Go Green Ambassadors Programme is to provide structured training for a group of dedicated student leaders to:

*   cultivate the habit of living a green lifestyle,     
*   take an active interest in raising the awareness of others on environmental issues,      
*   take the initiative to spread environmental messages to family and friends, and 
*   organise and participate in activities to promote care and protection for the environment.
