### **Aesthetics**
#### **Vision**
Creative Learners, Appreciative Audience of the Arts

#### **Mission**
To develop studentsâ€™ ability in communicating thoughts, ideas and feelings through visual and performing arts

#### **Belief**
At TKPS, we believe that the Arts play an important part in the holistic development of our students. It taps into their inquisitive and creative nature, and provides opportunities for them to discover different ways of expressing themselves, while at the same time learning about values and social-emotional competencies. This allows them to better appreciate, perceive and make sense of themselves and the world around them. 

#### **Approach**
The Aesthetics department develops our students through the 4Es approach - Exposure, Experience, Excursion and Expertise.
