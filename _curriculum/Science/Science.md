### **Science**
#### **Vision**
Curious Science Inquirers. Engaged Science Learners for Life and Society.

#### **Mission**
To inculcate a spirit of Science inquiry in our students so as to engage their Head (core ideas), Hands (practices) and Hearts (values, ethics and attitudes).

#### **Key Programmes**

##### E2K Science Programme

Our school offers the **EXCELLENCE 2000 (E2K) SCIENCE PROGRAMME** to selected primary 4 students. This is a science inquiry-based programme aimed to stretch primary pupils who have demonstrated strong interest and ability in science. It is adapted from Israel’s E2K Programme which is developed by the Israel Centre for Excellence through Education (ICEE). We have modified this enrichment programme to integrate technology where teachers use e-pedagogy to create a more participatory, connected and reflective classroom to nurture future-ready learners. 

Through this E2K Programme, we hope that pupils will develop scientific inquiry process skills, as well as nurture other important 21st century competencies such as resilience and resourcefulness, critical and inventive thinking, and effective communication skills. 

Pupils will learn Science by going through the same process that scientists use to generate knowledge in Science. Just as practising scientists make mistakes in the real world, pupils are allowed to make mistakes in E2K and teachers facilitate pupils to learn from the mistakes. Through collaborative learning and guidance provided by the teacher, pupils practise scientific thinking and reasoning, develop confidence and independence in carrying out scientific inquiry as well as scientific habits, attitudes and dispositions.

##### **Infusion of Science with English’s STELLAR Programme**
The Science in STELLAR Programme is a collaboration with the English department to infuse Science with learning English. Themes include “A Butterfly is Born”, “What Will the Weather Be Like Today?”, and “The Enormous Watermelon”. Cross-disciplinary activities are used to engage learners in the classroom and arouse their interests in Science.

##### **Inquiry Based Learning (IBL) Approach**
For the Primary 3 to Primary 6 students, the school uses the Inquiry Based Learning (IBL) Approach to arouse students’ interests in Science and engage their curious minds through questioning. The IBL approach encourages questioning by students and teachers. Through IBL, students learn to make connections between what they have learnt from prior experiences and what they are learning at present.

##### **Learning Journeys**
Science learning takes place beyond the classroom. Besides opportunities to observe and make comparisons between the different gardens in school, students also explore other habitats and communities such as the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, Singapore Zoo and the Singapore Science Centre. Learning Journeys aim to foster stronger connections between real-life experiences and its application in Science questions.

##### **TKPS Water Learning Trail**
Do you know the school has a Rain Garden and a Butterfly Garden? The school’s water learning trail aims to increase appreciation and awareness of water as a precious resource by learning the story of Singapore Water through various activities. The trail is facilitated by the school’s Green Ambassadors and teachers.
  
Students work in teams to find out how Singapore obtains its supply, and will visit the school’s rain garden and rooftop garden to understand the collection of rainwater runoff. Basic water quality tests are also introduced to engage students in understanding the standards of potable water.
