### **Science**
#### **Vision**
Curious Science Inquirers; Engaged Science Learners

#### **Mission**
To inculcate a spirit of Science Inquiry in our students so as to engage their Heads (Knowledge), Hands (Skills) and Hearts (Values).

#### **Key Programmes**
##### **P1 and P2 Modular Science Programme**
While Science is not taught at lower primary, students who show keen interest in Science may be selected to attend the in-house programme. It is never too early to arouse students’ interest and develop curious minds through exploration and understanding of phenomena observed in their daily lives.

##### **Infusion of Science with English’s STELLAR Programme**
The Science in STELLAR Programme is a collaboration with the English department to infuse Science with learning English. Themes include “A Butterfly is Born”, “What Will the Weather Be Like Today?”, and “The Enormous Watermelon”. Cross-disciplinary activities are used to engage learners in the classroom and arouse their interests in Science.

##### **Inquiry Based Learning (IBL) Approach**
For the Primary 3 to Primary 6 students, the school uses the Inquiry Based Learning (IBL) Approach to arouse students’ interests in Science and engage their curious minds through questioning. The IBL approach encourages questioning by students and teachers. Through IBL, students learn to make connections between what they have learnt from prior experiences and what they are learning at present.

##### **Learning Journeys**
Science learning takes place beyond the classroom. Besides opportunities to observe and make comparisons between the different gardens in school, students also explore other habitats and communities such as the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, Singapore Zoo and the Singapore Science Centre. Learning Journeys aim to foster stronger connections between real-life experiences and its application in Science questions.

##### **TKPS Water Learning Trail**
Do you know the school has a Rain Garden and a Butterfly Garden? The school’s water learning trail aims to increase appreciation and awareness of water as a precious resource by learning the story of Singapore Water through various activities. The trail is facilitated by the school’s Green Ambassadors and teachers.
  
Students work in teams to find out how Singapore obtains its supply, and will visit the school’s rain garden and rooftop garden to understand the collection of rainwater runoff. Basic water quality tests are also introduced to engage students in understanding the standards of potable water.
