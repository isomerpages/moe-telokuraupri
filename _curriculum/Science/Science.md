<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>Curious Science Inquirers. Engaged Science Learners for Life and Society.</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>To inculcate a spirit of Science inquiry in our students so as to engage
their Head (core ideas), Hands (practices) and Hearts (values, ethics and
attitudes).</p>
<h4><strong><u>Key Programmes</u></strong></h4>
<h5>E2K Science Programme</h5>
<p>Our school offers the <strong>EXCELLENCE 2000 (E2K) SCIENCE PROGRAMME</strong> to
selected primary 4 students. This is a science inquiry-based programme
aimed to stretch primary pupils who have demonstrated strong interest and
ability in science. It is adapted from Israel’s E2K Programme which is
developed by the Israel Centre for Excellence through Education (ICEE).
We have modified this enrichment programme to integrate technology where
teachers use e-pedagogy to create a more participatory, connected and reflective
classroom to nurture future-ready learners.</p>
<p>Through this E2K Programme, we hope that pupils will develop scientific
inquiry process skills, as well as nurture other important 21st century
competencies such as resilience and resourcefulness, critical and inventive
thinking, and effective communication skills.</p>
<p>Pupils will learn Science by going through the same process that scientists
use to generate knowledge in Science. Just as practising scientists make
mistakes in the real world, pupils are allowed to make mistakes in E2K
and teachers facilitate pupils to learn from the mistakes. Through collaborative
learning and guidance provided by the teacher, pupils practise scientific
thinking and reasoning, develop confidence and independence in carrying
out scientific inquiry as well as scientific habits, attitudes and dispositions.</p>

<h5><strong>Infusion of Science with English’s STELLAR Programme</strong></h5>
<p>The Science in STELLAR Programme is a collaboration with the English department
to infuse Science with learning English. Themes include “A Butterfly is
Born”, “What Will the Weather Be Like Today?”, and “The Enormous Watermelon”.
Cross-disciplinary activities are used to engage learners in the classroom
and arouse their interests in Science.</p>
<h5><strong>Inquiry Based Learning (IBL) Approach</strong></h5>
<p>For the Primary 3 to Primary 6 students, the school uses the Inquiry Based
Learning (IBL) Approach to arouse students’ interests in Science and engage
their curious minds through questioning. The IBL approach encourages questioning
by students and teachers. Through IBL, students learn to make connections
between what they have learnt from prior experiences and what they are
learning at present.</p>

<h5><strong>Learning Journeys</strong></h5>
<p>Science learning takes place beyond the classroom. Besides opportunities
to observe and make comparisons between the different gardens in school,
students also explore other habitats and communities such as the Sungei
Buloh Wetland Reserve, Singapore Zoo and the Singapore Science Centre.
Learning Journeys aim to foster stronger connections between real-life
experiences and its application in Science questions.</p>

<h5><strong>TKPS Water Learning Trail</strong></h5>
<p>Do you know the school has a Rain Garden and a Butterfly Garden? The school’s
water learning trail aims to increase appreciation and awareness of water
as a precious resource by learning the story of Singapore Water through
various activities. The trail is facilitated by the school’s Green Ambassadors
and teachers.</p>
<p>Students work in teams to find out how Singapore obtains its supply, and
will visit the school’s rain garden and rooftop garden to understand the
collection of rainwater runoff. Basic water quality tests are also introduced
to engage students in understanding the standards of potable water.</p>
