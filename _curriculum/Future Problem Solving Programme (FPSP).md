<h5><strong>What is the future problem solving programe (FPSP)?</strong></h5>
<p>The&nbsp;Future Problem Solving Programme (FPSP)&nbsp;is a dynamic international
programme developed in 1974 by creativity pioneer, Dr. E. Paul Torrance.
It comprises several components, both competitive and non-competitive,
which aims to develop creative and critical thinking, problem solving and
decision making skills.</p>
<p>Telok Kurau Primary School participates in the Global Issues Problem Solving
(GIPS) component as a team. Students will learn the six-step creative problem
solving process and use it to respond to a Future Scene provided for each
topic.</p>

<h5><strong>FPSP in Telok Kurau Primary</strong></h5>
<p>Introduced in our school in 2017, the FPSP is a two-year programme offered
to a selected group of primary 4 and 5 students. At Primary 4, students
learn about the six-step creative problem solving process using authentic
learning scenarios. At Primary 5, an emphasis is placed on developing their
research and analytical skills. Through cooperative learning, students
stretch their imagination to generate innovative solutions to solve the
problems of emerging realities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A group of TKPS teachers are trained as FPSP coaches to conduct the programme.
The school provides a variety of opportunities for students to learn and
apply the skills through engaging hands-on activities.</p>
