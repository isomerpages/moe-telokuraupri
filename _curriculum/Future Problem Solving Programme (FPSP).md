##### **What is the future problem solving programe (FPSP)?**
The Future Problem Solving Programme (FPSP) is a dynamic international programme developed in 1974 by creativity pioneer, Dr. E. Paul Torrance. It comprises several components, both competitive and non-competitive, which aims to develop creative and critical thinking, problem solving and decision making skills.

Telok Kurau Primary School participates in the Global Issues Problem Solving (GIPS) component as a team. Students will learn the six-step creative problem solving process and use it to respond to a Future Scene provided for each topic.

##### **Scope of topics**
The topics selected by the FPSP represent themes and concepts ranging from Business and Economics, Social and Political, and Science and Technology. Topics are very current, but also require students to explore possibilities and solutions for the future.

Topics in 2019/2020 include International Travel, Sleep Patterns, Gamification, Living in Poverty and Terraforming.

##### **FPSP in Telok Kurau Primary**
Introduced in our school in 2017, the FPSP is a two-year programme offered to a selected group of primary 4 and 5 students. At Primary 4, students learn about the six-step creative problem solving process using authentic learning scenarios. At Primary 5, an emphasis is placed on developing their research and analytical skills. Through cooperative learning, students stretch their imagination to generate innovative solutions to solve the problems of emerging realities. 

A group of TKPS teachers are trained as FPSP coaches to conduct the programme. The school provides a variety of opportunities for students to learn and apply the skills through engaging hands-on activities.
