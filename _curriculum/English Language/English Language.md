<h3><strong>English Language</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>Confident and Effective Communicators</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>Creating a rich learning environment for students to enjoy language learning
and develop language skills</p>
<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>A. STELLAR Programme</strong></h5>
<p>STELLAR (<strong>S</strong>trategies for&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>nglish&nbsp;<strong>L</strong>anguage&nbsp;<strong>L</strong>earning
and&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>eading) is an English Language instructional
programme adopted at all levels in Telok Kurau Primary School. Students
are immersed in language learning and are exposed to a variety of genres
that are engaging and age-appropriate. The use of different strategies
and pedagogies with explicit instruction in all language skills, as well
as enriching language experiences, allow our students to appreciate the
language within and beyond the classrooms.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Shared experiences such as sandwich-making and bubble-blowing activities
provide the context and content for the students to think and talk about.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
<br>As part of the language experience, lower primary students also go on
learning journeys. These authentic experiences help students communicate
what they have gone through before embarking on writing.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As students move on to the upper primary levels, they learn to make the
transition from learning to read, to reading to learn. Students are eased
into reading silently as well as reading longer texts without visual support.
Teachers continue to provide students with guidance in the processes of
planning, writing and reviewing before they apply these skills in writing,
independently.</p>
<h5><strong>Reading Programme</strong></h5>
<p>We believe that reading is the foundation for effective language literacy
acquisition. Through meaningful and exciting activities, we aim to build
a community of engaged and lifelong readers.</p>
<p><strong>i. Book Buzz</strong>
<br>Book Buzz are assembly talks aimed at introducing students current reading
trends and good reads. This is a platform to acquaint students with the
various genres ranging from fantasy fiction to mystery and adventure. To
cater to the different profiles of readers, Book Buzz is delivered through
enjoyable elements such as movie trailers, games and quizzes.</p>
<p><strong>ii. Weekly Library Lesson</strong>
<br>Weekly library lessons are more than just about borrowing books from the
Media Resource Library (MRL). EL teachers conduct focused lessons to equip
students with simple yet handy tips in selecting suitable and age-appropriate
books that meet their interests. These lessons also provide students greater
opportunities to interact around books as they make connections between
what they read and the real world. Opportunities are also provided for
them to share and recommend what they have read with their classmates during
these lessons.</p>

<p><strong>iii. What’s Up Newspapers (P4 – P6)</strong>
<br>Primary 4, 5 and 6 students subscribe to What’s Up yearly. It is to inculcate
the habit of reading newspapers from young and to expose students to news
and current events. Articles from What’s Up are used to connect our upper
primary students to the world. Teachers use these authentic recounts as
well as the use of thinking routines such as See-Think-Wonder (STW) and
Circle of Viewpoints (COV) to lead the class in discussion. As students
think about the values that are reflected in the articles, they also develop
critical and empathetic views about the world around them.</p>
<h5><strong>Moo-O Plus (P1 &amp; P2)</strong></h5>
<p>In developing reading fluency and speaking skills, students use an interactive
tool that seamlessly supports the core curriculum called Moo-O plus. As
they immerse themselves in the stories, students are transformed into story
book characters before putting their reading and speaking skills to practice.</p>

<h5><strong>Support Programmes</strong></h5>
<p><strong>i. Learning Support Programme</strong>
<br>The Learning Support Programme (LSP) is an MOE-initiated programme which
aims to provide early intervention and support for selected Primary 1 and
Primary 2 students in their learning. The objective of LSP is to equip
students with basic literacy skills so that they can access learning in
the regular classroom. These lessons are conducted in small groups daily
during school curriculum hours by a trained Learning Support Coordinator
(LSC).</p>
<p><strong>ii. School-based Dyslexia Remediation</strong>
<br>The School-based Dyslexia Remediation (SDR) programme aims to provide
support for Primary 3 and Primary 4 students who have been identified through
a systematic screening process for dyslexia conducted at the end of Primary
2. This programme seeks to enable the selected students to acquire coping
strategies in reading so that they will be better able to cope with their
learning in school. The programme relies on a systematic set of strategies
and activities which have been carefully designed by MOE.</p>
<p><strong>iii. Reading Remediation Programme</strong>
<br>The Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) aims to provide support for Primary
3 and Primary 4 students who face consistent difficulty in reading despite
having completed the Learning Support Programme in P1 and P2. This MOE-initiated
programme exposes students to a range of coping strategies for reading
comprehension which will enable them to better support their learning in
the regular classroom.</p>
