### **English Language**
#### **Vision**
Confident and Effective Communicators

#### **Mission**
Creating a rich learning environment for students to enjoy language learning and develop language skills

#### **Key Programmes**
##### **A. STELLAR Programme**
STELLAR (**S**trategies for **E**nglish **L**anguage **L**earning and **R**eading) is an English Language instructional programme adopted at all levels in Telok Kurau Primary School. Students are immersed in language learning and are exposed to a variety of genres that are engaging and age-appropriate. The use of different strategies and pedagogies with explicit instruction in all language skills, as well as enriching language experiences, allow our students to appreciate the language within and beyond the classrooms.

Shared experiences such as sandwich-making and bubble-blowing activities provide the context and content for the students to think and talk about.

As part of the language experience, lower primary students also go on learning journeys. These authentic experiences help students communicate what they have gone through before embarking on writing.

As students move on to the upper primary levels, they learn to make the transition from learning to read, to reading to learn. Students are eased into reading silently as well as reading longer texts without visual support. Teachers continue to provide students with guidance in the processes of planning, writing and reviewing before they apply these skills in writing, independently.

##### **Reading Programme**
We believe that reading is the foundation for effective language literacy acquisition. Through meaningful and exciting activities, we aim to build a community of engaged and lifelong readers.

**i.	Book Buzz**<br>
Book Buzz are assembly talks aimed at introducing students current reading trends and good reads. This is a platform to acquaint students with the various genres ranging from fantasy fiction to mystery and adventure. To cater to the different profiles of readers, Book Buzz is delivered through enjoyable elements such as movie trailers, games and quizzes.

**ii.	Weekly Library Lesson**<br>
Weekly library lessons are more than just about borrowing books from the Media Resource Library (MRL). EL teachers conduct focused lessons to equip students with simple yet handy tips in selecting suitable and age-appropriate books that meet their interests. These lessons also provide students greater opportunities to interact around books as they make connections between what they read and the real world. Opportunities are also provided for them to share and recommend what they have read with their classmates during these lessons.

**iii.	What’s Up Newspapers (P4 – P6)**<br>
Primary 4, 5 and 6 students subscribe to What’s Up yearly. It is to inculcate the habit of reading newspapers from young and to expose students to news and current events. Articles from What’s Up are used to connect our upper primary students to the world. Teachers use these authentic recounts as well as the use of thinking routines such as See-Think-Wonder (STW) and Circle of Viewpoints (COV) to lead the class in discussion. As students think about the values that are reflected in the articles, they also develop critical and empathetic views about the world around them.

##### **Moo-O Plus (P1 & P2)**
In developing reading fluency and speaking skills, students use an interactive tool that seamlessly supports the core curriculum called Moo-O plus. As they immerse themselves in the stories, students are transformed into story book characters before putting their reading and speaking skills to practice.

##### **Support Programmes**
**i.	Learning Support Programme**<br>
The Learning Support Programme (LSP) is an MOE-initiated programme which aims to provide early intervention and support for selected Primary 1 and Primary 2 students in their learning. The objective of LSP is to equip students with basic literacy skills so that they can access learning in the regular classroom. These lessons are conducted in small groups daily during school curriculum hours by a trained Learning Support Coordinator (LSC).

**ii.	School-based Dyslexia Remediation**<br>
The School-based Dyslexia Remediation (SDR) programme aims to provide support for Primary 3 and Primary 4 students who have been identified through a systematic screening process for dyslexia conducted at the end of Primary 2. This programme seeks to enable the selected students to acquire coping strategies in reading so that they will be better able to cope with their learning in school. The programme relies on a systematic set of strategies and activities which have been carefully designed by MOE.

**iii.	Reading Remediation Programme**<br>
The Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) aims to provide support for Primary 3 and Primary 4 students who face consistent difficulty in reading despite having completed the Learning Support Programme in P1 and P2. This MOE-initiated programme exposes students to a range of coping strategies for reading comprehension which will enable them to better support their learning in the regular classroom.
