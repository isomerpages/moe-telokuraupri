<p><strong>Future Problem Solving Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Future Problem Solving Programme (FPSP) is a dynamic international
programme developed in 1974 by creativity pioneer, Dr. E. Paul Torrance.
It comprises several components, both competitive and non-competitive,
which aims to develop creative and critical thinking, problem solving and
decision making skills.
<br>
<br>Telok Kurau Primary School participates in the Global Issues Problem Solving
(GIPS) component as a team. Students will learn the six-step creative problem
solving process and use it to respond to a Future Scene provided for each
topic. At Primary 5, an emphasis is placed on developing their research
and analytical skills. Through cooperative learning, students stretch their
imagination to generate innovative solutions to solve the problems of emerging
realities.
