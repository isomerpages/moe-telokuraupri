### **School History**
#### **The Beginning**
Telok Kurau English School started in 1926. It was situated at Telok Kurau Road from which it derived its name. The words “telok kurau” is Malay for “mango fish bay” – “telok” means “bay” and “kurau” is “mango fish”.  

The school was set up to cater to a thriving population eager to be educated in English. Lessons started for a dozen students who were all boys.

The school was a simple two-storey wooden structure set amidst a vast coconut plantation, a typical rural school in the early colonial days. There were twelve classrooms, a hall and a tuckshop. The late former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew was enrolled as a student in January 1930 and the late former Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Hussein Onn in January 1931.

In 1958, a new wing was added to accommodate more students. During this period, two other schools bearing the name "Telok Kurau" were built; the Telok Kurau Malay Girls’ School in 1960 and the Telok Kurau West School in 1962. These were built to cater to the growth of the school-going population within the Telok Kurau and Joo Chiat estates. Telok Kurau English School then became known as Telok Kurau East School.

#### **The Transition**
In 1967, a new school building was constructed at 408 Joo Chiat Place. This replaced the old wooden building fronting Lorong J and was officially opened in 1968. For the first time, girls were enrolled in Telok Kurau East School. By 1969, the school population had risen to 2500.

In 1983, Telok Kurau Malay Girl's School merged with Telok Kurau West School. It then joined Telok Kurau East School in 1985 and was renamed Telok Kurau Primary School.

#### **The Merger**
In 2001, the school merged with Bedok Town Primary School and moved to its present site at 50 Bedok Reservoir Road.

Throughout its history, TKPS braved several difficult periods and emerged stronger each time. TKPS stands as an educational cornerstone in the Bedok Reservoir neighbourhood. Besides offering a holistic education, it also provides opportunities for its students to take on greater challenges in the future.  

In 2014, the school leveraged its strong history of team sports to offer as its Learning for Life Programme (LLP), Character Development through Team Sports. Following that, the school designated as its Applied Learning Programme (ALP), Innovative Thinking through Coding and Robotics, in 2017.
