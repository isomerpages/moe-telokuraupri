<h4><strong>The Beginning</strong></h4><p>Telok Kurau English School started in 1926. It was situated at Telok Kurau Road from which it derived its name. The words “telok kurau” is Malay for “mango fish bay” – “telok” means “bay” and “kurau” is “mango fish”.</p><p>The school was set up to cater to a thriving population eager to be educated in English. Lessons started for a dozen students who were all boys.</p><p>The school was a simple two-storey wooden structure set amidst a vast coconut plantation, a typical rural school in the early colonial days. There were twelve classrooms, a hall and a tuckshop. The late former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew was enrolled as a student in January 1930 and the late former Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Hussein Onn in January 1931.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/history1.png"></div><p>In 1958, a new wing was added to accommodate more students. During this period, two other schools bearing the name "Telok Kurau" were built; the Telok Kurau Malay Girls’ School in 1960 and the Telok Kurau West School in 1962. These were built to cater to the growth of the school-going population within the Telok Kurau and Joo Chiat estates. Telok Kurau English School then became known as Telok Kurau East School.</p><h4><strong>The Transition</strong></h4><p>In 1967, a new school building was constructed at 408 Joo Chiat Place. This replaced the old wooden building fronting Lorong J and was officially opened in 1968. For the first time, girls were enrolled in Telok Kurau East School. By 1969, the school population had risen to 2500.</p><p>In 1983, Telok Kurau Malay Girl's School merged with Telok Kurau West School. It then joined Telok Kurau East School in 1985 and was renamed Telok Kurau Primary School.</p><h4><strong>The Merger</strong></h4><p>In 2001, the school merged with Bedok Town Primary School and moved to its present site at 50 Bedok Reservoir Road.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/history2.png"></div><h4><strong>Telok Kurau Primary School Today</strong></h4><p>Throughout its history, TKPS braved several difficult periods and emerged stronger each time.
