### **School Crest**

![](/images/About%20TKPS/tkps_logo-new.png)

Education is a lifelong endeavour in the pursuit of excellence.

Aligned to this belief, the letter ‘T’ at the heart of the school crest is symbolic of continual learning and growth of both teachers and students.

The crest is bounded by two rings, symbolising a well-rounded and holistic education within a caring and nurturing environment.

The logo comprises 3 main colours; Blue conveys discipline and stability. White is the colour of equality and honesty while yellow signifies creativity and curiosity.

友诺小学 - the Chinese name of Telok Kurau Primary School symbolises the promise of friendship, uniting the two schools as one.
