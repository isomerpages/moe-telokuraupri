### **School Core Values**
The core values in TKPS reflect those of the Character and Citizenship Education syllabus. “The core values (Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Harmony) are fundamental for a person of good character and a useful citizen of Singapore. They guide students to discern between right and wrong, help them to make responsible choices and become more aware of their roles in society.”<br>(CCE Syllabus 2014 p. 2)
