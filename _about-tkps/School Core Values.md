### **School Core Values**
The core values in TKPS reflect those of the Character and Citizenship Education syllabus. “The core values (Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Harmony) are fundamental for a person of good character and a useful citizen of Singapore. They guide students to discern between right and wrong, help them to make responsible choices and become more aware of their roles in society.”<br>(CCE Syllabus 2014 p. 2)
<br><br>
I show **RESPECT** when I value and show consideration for self and others.
<br><br>
I am **RESPONSIBLE** when I know an do what is right.
<br><br>
I am **RESILIENT** as I have courage an I do not give up in the face of challenges,
<br><br>
I am a person with **INTEGRITY** and high ethical standards, and will stand up for what is right.
<br><br>
I show **CARE** when I think of others and put others before self.
<br><br>
I value **HARMONY** by valuing and maintaining good relationships with others regardless of background.
