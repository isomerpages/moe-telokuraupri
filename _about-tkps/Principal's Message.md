<h4><strong>Recollection with Gratitude</strong></h4>
<p>As we welcome a brand new year, our hearts are filled with gratitude.
We recollect the extraordinary journey that we took as a school in 2024
as we embraced change and redefined success. Thank you for journeying with
us as we embarked on a series of structural, behavioural and mindset changes.</p>
<p>We are heartened to see the children enjoying the new facilities – RICHIE
Café, Student Care Centre, broadened walkways, as well as the Waves of
Wisdom Library. The Aquaponics and Heritage Gallery will be officially
ready in the first quarter of 2025. This is followed by the creation of
new learning spaces known as the <em>Learning Space Catalyst</em> at the
various parts of the school. Our staff and students have adopted new approach
to teaching and learning, tapping on the new facilities and learning spaces
to enhance the educational experience. As we move forward into a new school
year, we look forward to even greater opportunities for exploration and
growth for our children to experience.</p>
<h4><strong>2025 Theme: Exploring Possibilities, Empowering People</strong></h4>
<p>In this new phase of our growth, the school will venture deeper into exploring
possibilities, as we empower our students and those who support them along
the way.&nbsp; The theme for 2025 is not just a reflection of our aspirations
but a call to action for students, staff and parents to work collaboratively.
We are confident that, together, we can nurture the desired qualities that
empower our students to shape their futures, make meaningful contributions
as they lead with purpose.</p>
<p>The theme is anchored in four key focal points where we, as educators
and parents, can support our children so that they enjoy learning and,
eventually, succeed in life:</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Focus on Purpose: </strong>Empower
our children to foster a sense of responsibility and take ownership of
their actions and decisions. Encourage them to set realistic goals and
pursue them with joy and determination.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dare to Dream: </strong>Encourage
our children to try new things and foster a growth mindset. Create a safe
environment for failures so that they can all learn from mistakes while
staying resilient on their learning journeys.</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be Curious: </strong>Nurture
curiosity by exposing our children to new ideas and experiences. Support
them by providing resources that can fuel their curiosity—books, documentaries,
strike conversations with them so that they can gain new insights. Broaden
their horizons with visits to museums, libraries, or cultural events.</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Synergise: </strong>Celebrate
diversity by encouraging our children to seek out and learn from people
with different perspectives, cultures and skills. Encourage them to value
friendships and appreciate the commonalities and differences among one
another.</p>
<p>The path ahead is full of adventures. Together, let’s foster an environment
where our children can explore new possibilities, be empowered to lead
with purpose and compassion, so as to positively impact the people around
them.<strong> </strong>Thank you for being a crucial part of this journey.</p>
