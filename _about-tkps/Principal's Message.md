<h4><strong>Celebrating 100 Years of Excellence: Telok Kurau Primary School</strong></h4>
<p>From humble beginnings in 1926, Telok Kurau Primary School has grown into
a vibrant, multicultural community of learners. Over the years, we have
evolved through mergers with Telok Kurau Malay Girls’ School, Telok Kurau
West School, Bedok Town Primary School and Eunos Primary School. We honour
the good leadership, unity of purpose and strong dedication that have shaped
our journey.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Guided by our centennial theme - <strong><em>Inspiring Innovation, Enabling Transformation,</em></strong> we
invite our stakeholders to join us in this new phase of school development.
We remain committed to creating opportunities that ignite a passion for
learning, supporting student well-being and deepening shared values as
we nurture Confident Leaders, Resilient Learners, and Caring Citizens in
a community that celebrates diversity, inclusion and mutual respect.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The theme is anchored in four key focal points:</p>
<p><strong><em>We Care</em></strong> places the well-being of every child
at the heart of all we do. It emphasises respect, empathy, and positive
relationships, creating a safe, inclusive and supportive learning environment.
Care is the foundation for trust, growth and belonging, ensuring every
member of our diverse school community feels valued.</p>
<p><strong><em>We Design</em></strong> encourages creativity, curiosity and
purposeful thinking. Through programmes like <em>FutureQuest, Innovative Thinking through Coding and Robotics, Voices and Perspectives, and Express and Empower</em>,
students engage in real-world, theme-based projects—from STEM challenges
and environmental initiatives to cultural exploration and community problem-solving.
Learning is hands-on, inquiry-driven and connected to meaningful contexts,
nurturing future-ready leaders with the essential 21 century competencies.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><em>We Empower</em></strong> nurtures confident, resilient and
self-directed learners. Students are given opportunities to lead, voice
their ideas and take ownership of their learning. This focus builds character,
responsibility and independence, preparing our students to face challenges
with confidence and make a positive difference in a diverse yet interconnected
world.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><em>We Transform</em></strong> inspires action and positive change.
Students apply their learning to make meaningful impact on themselves,
others and the community. Our transformed learning spaces, including flexible
classrooms, collaborative hubs and innovation areas support active and
purposeful learning, while fostering curiosity, exploration and cross-cultural
understanding.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As we celebrate a century of impact, we honour our past, embrace the present
and look forward to a future full of possibilities. Together, we will continue
to inspire, innovate and shape the future of learning for every student
in our diverse and inclusive community.</p>
