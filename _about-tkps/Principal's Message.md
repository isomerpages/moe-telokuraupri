<br>Principal

Telok Kurau Primary, 友诺小学，welcomes all of you!
<br><br>
2023 is going to be an exciting year! The merger of Telok Kurau Primary and Eunos Primary presents us with vast opportunities and possibilities to co-create an even better future for all of us. My staff and I are committed to partner you in nurturing and developing our children to enjoy learning and be future-ready. Our school envisions our students to be confident leaders, resilient learners and caring citizens.  We believe that all our students can learn and want to excel. As such, we seek to grow our students in a values-driven environment to achieve excellence and contribute actively to the society. 
<br><br>
Our school curriculum is designed to bring forth a student-centric, values-driven holistic education where students develop 21st century competencies that are essential to thrive and flourish in the globalised world. The learning experiences and programmes curated are age-appropriate, vibrant and promote curiosity, joy of learning and student agency.
<br><br>
Our school places great emphasis on student character development. One of the platforms is our Learning for Life Programme (LLP), Character Development through Team Sports. It offers students opportunities to strengthen their growing minds and to test their mettle as they enjoy the physical sports and games through our Physical and Health Education (PHE), Programme for Active Learning (PAL) and our wide array of Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs). In 2023, we have 18 CCAs ranging from physical sports to visual and performing arts, clubs and societies, as well as uniform groups. Our CCAs are weaved into curriculum time to ensure balanced and conducive learning opportunities for all our children. 
<br><br>
Our students are also provided with authentic, relevant and applicable learning opportunities within and outside of school.  Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), Critical and Innovative Thinking in Coding and Robotics, develops in our students logical thinking, problem-solving and communication skills. Through block-based programming, our students deepen their ability to think creatively and to collaborate in teams. They aspire to apply their knowledge and skills to benefit others in the Bedok community as active contributors. 
<br><br>
Our school has grown in capacity and capabilities with the two schools coming together as one. It takes a village to grow a child and we have expanded our “village”. We are confident that the transition experience of the merger will be a smooth one with the strong support of all stakeholders. We are thankful for the unwavering support, love and commitment given to our staff and students. We are ready to embark on our new journey as one.

#OneTKPS unites!

The torch symbolises knowledge and the book represents the key to learning and attaining knowledge. Education is a lifelong endeavour in the pursuit of excellence. The everlasting glow from the torch symbolises staff and students continuously learning together as one, striving to achieve our personal best.
