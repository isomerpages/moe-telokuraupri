### **Principal's Message**

<img src="/images/principal1.jpg" style="width:30%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

<br>A very warm welcome to the Telok Kurau Primary School (TKPS) website! Whether you are here as a student, parent, alumni of the school, or just browsing, I hope that we are able to provide a good overview of the school, insights into school life at TKPS and some ideas about what makes TKPS unique for its many stakeholders.

First and foremost, some updates about the school in 2021. To mark our 95th birthday in 2021, we worked with local artist Lee Xin Li to create a beautiful mural depicting the different stages of development the school has undergone, starting from its humble beginnings as a rural school in a coconut plantation in 1926. It was here that late former Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew and the late former Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Hussein Onn studied. The school moved locations and joined with other schools, before finally becoming Telok Kurau Primary School in 1985.

The mural shows students and staff in different uniforms and settings, from colonial times to early independence and finally the modern era. What remains consistent is the school’s focus on its students, the care that is extended to every child who passes through its gates and the support given so that they can strive for excellence.

Secondly, TKPS stands at the cusp of a new era as we prepare for merger with Eunos Primary School in 2023. While a merger may bring with it some uncertainty and trepidation, we will leverage this change to strive for excellence, to pick the best of both schools so that we can strive for excellence.

Lastly, in 2022, the school has taken on the challenge of including Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) within curriculum time. This ensures that all our P3 – P6 students have the opportunity to participate in a CCA which is a natural platform for teamwork, talent development and character building. Many TKPS students also go on to use their CCA and leadership talents in the Direct School Admission (DSA) exercise.

We have adapted and done well in the face of the evolving Covid situation since 2020. Our students and staff have been real troopers, adjusting and learning despite changes and challenges. I believe that each and every one of us are raring to go, ready to learn and grow together as individuals and as a school in 2022!
