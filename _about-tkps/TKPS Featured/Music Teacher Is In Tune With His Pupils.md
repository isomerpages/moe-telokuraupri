<p>TNP interviewed Mr Jonathan Tan, a music teacher in Telok Kurau Primary
School. In 2013, Mr Tan created his own ensemble with other enthusiasts,
called the Dicapella Dixi Ensemble.</p>
<p></p>
<p>During music lessons, Mr Tan teaches students to learn new instruments
such as a recorder or ukulele. When students are frustrated or find it
challenging to learn the instrument, he shares his experiences when learning
the dizi and how he tackles issues such as breath control.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mr Tan makes learning a new instrument a joy for students by exploring
different sounds they can make, such as squeaking noises and the sound
of birds chirping, which amuses the students. He aims to inspire more students
to enjoy learning music.</p>
