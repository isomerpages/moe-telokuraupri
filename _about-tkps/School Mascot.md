### **School Mascot**
RICHIE, the school mascot, is a familiar face during school events and well-loved by everyone in TKPS. Introduced in 2010, its name was suggested by students and teachers as it bears the initials of the school’s core values – Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Harmony). RICHIE plays an integral role in the school life of students in TKPS, and his presence often evokes school pride and spirit.
