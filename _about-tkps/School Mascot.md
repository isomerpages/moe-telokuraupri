<h4><strong>School Mascot</strong></h4>
<p>RICHIE, the school mascot, is a familiar face during school events and
well-loved by everyone in TKPS. Introduced in 2010, its name was suggested
by students and teachers as it bears the initials of the school’s core
values – Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Harmony.
RICHIE plays an integral role in the school life of students in TKPS, and
his presence often evokes school pride and spirit.
