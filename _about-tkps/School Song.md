### **School Song**
#### **Lyrics**
Telok Kurau Primary School<br>
Honesty each day is our rule<br>
Caring we share, together uphold<br>
Our pride and dignity to our goal
  
We pledge our loyalty here and now<br>
Success and glory for Telok Kurau
  
Telok Kurau Primary School<br>
Courage we will have as our tool<br>
Home of our childhood, we study and play<br>
With love and unity grow each day
  
We pledge our loyalty here and now<br>
Success and glory for Telok Kurau

_Music and Lyrics composed and arranged by Eleanor Roy, ex-teacher of Telok Kurau Primary School_
