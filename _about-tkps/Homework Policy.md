####  **Homework Policy**

At Telok Kurau Primary School, we give due consideration to how much time is appropriate for students to complete their homework at each level, according to their aptitude. The responsibilities of the each TKPS student include the following:

1. Listen to homework instructions in class.<br>
2. Copy down instructions for the task and deadline date into their Student Handbook.<br>
3. Ensure that homework is completed and handed in by the deadline.<br>
4. Attempt all work and give his/her best to each piece of assignment.<br>
5. Inform the subject teacher of any difficulties in doing them.
