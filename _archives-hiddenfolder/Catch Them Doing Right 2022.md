### **Catch Them Doing Right 2022**
“Catch Them Doing Right" (CTDR) is a TKPS initiative to recognise students, staff and parents for their good deeds and actions. It reinforces positive behaviour, motivating us to be good role models.

This year, in conjunction with Teachers’ Day, we have invited parents and students to write messages of affirmation to our teachers and school staff. These are some of the messages. Thank you for the words of affirmation and encouragement.
