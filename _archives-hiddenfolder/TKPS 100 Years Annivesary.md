<p><strong><u>Unveiling the TKPS100 Logo: A Celebration of Legacy, Unity, and Vision</u></strong>
</p>
<p>As Telok Kurau Primary School commemorates its 100th anniversary, we are
proud to unveil the <strong>TKPS100</strong> logo — a meaningful emblem that
reflects our rich heritage, shared values and forward-looking aspirations.</p>
<p>Co-created by our dedicated staff community, the logo is a true reflection
of the <em>#OneTKPS</em> spirit. Every detail — from colours and symbols
to design inspirations — was thoughtfully contributed, making the final
creation both deeply personal and proudly collective.</p>
<p>Anchored in the centennial theme “Inspiring Innovations, Enabling Transformations,”
the logo was birthed during a special staff bonding session. Teachers and
staff across departments came together to brainstorm, sketch and share
what TKPS represents to each of us — in the past, the present and for generations
to come.</p>
<p>More than just a visual identity, the TKPS100 logo stands as a powerful
symbol of our legacy, our continued growth and the transformative journey
that lies ahead.</p>
