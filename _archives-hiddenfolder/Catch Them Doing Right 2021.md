### **Catch Them Doing Right 2021**
â€œCatch Them Doing Right" (CTDR) is a TKPS initiative to recognise students, staff and parents for their good deeds and actions. It reinforces positive behaviour, motivating us to be good role models. Through the CTDR platform, parents have left words of appreciation to affirm school staff who have positively impacted their children.
