<p>Established in 2000, Telok Kurau Primary School’s Lion Dance troupe was
formed to introduce students to the rich cultural heritage of traditional
Chinese performing arts. Over the years, it has grown into a vibrant and
respected CCA that goes beyond performance, nurturing character, resilience,
and discipline among its members.
<br>
<br>In 2024, the CCA expanded to include Dragon Dance, offering students an
even broader platform to develop technical skills, teamwork, and a strong
sense of commitment. Under the dedicated guidance of teachers and coaches,
students are trained not only in performance techniques but also in upholding
high standards of discipline and adhering strictly to safety protocols
during practice.
<br>
<br>Despite the physical and mental demands, the students’ passion and perseverance
have led the troupe to achieve recognition in prestigious competitions,
such as the Nanyang Technological University Institutional Lion Dance Competition.
Their participation in community events further instills a strong sense
of pride, cultural identity, and community contribution, shaping them into
confident and responsible young leaders.</p>
