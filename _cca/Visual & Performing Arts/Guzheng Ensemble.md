<p>he Guzheng Ensemble is an important CCA, in cultivating a genuine love
and a lifelong passion for music amongst its members. We aim to help them
achieve mastery as they learn to play beautiful pieces of music! Since
its establishment, the ensemble has embarked on the journey of musicianship,
and its members have learnt the values of respect, resilience and excellence.</p>
<p>Members are imbued with a strong sense of responsibility towards their
guzheng by ensuring it is well tuned and put in their best during performances.
They learn to work collaboratively as a team and play together as one.
Members are given the opportunity to also perform at various school platforms
as well as the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (SYF AP).</p>
