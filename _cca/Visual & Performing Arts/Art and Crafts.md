<p>The school’s Art and Crafts CCA provides a creative platform for students
to explore and expand their artistic talents beyond the classroom. It nurtures
budding artists by exposing them to a wide variety of art forms, encouraging
both individual expression and collaborative creation.
<br>
<br>Through engaging in diverse art projects, members deepen their understanding
of the visual arts while developing essential skills and techniques. The
CCA also introduces students to the 8 Studio Habits of Mind—such as observing,
reflecting, and persisting—helping them think and work like true artists.
<br>
<br>As they create and collaborate, students learn to appreciate art, communicate
visually, and understand the importance of art in society. The CCA cultivates
not only artistic competence but also creativity, confidence, and a deeper
cultural awareness.</p>
