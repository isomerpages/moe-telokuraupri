<p>The TKPS Chinese Dance CCA nurtures our studentsâ€™ aesthetic appreciation
and deepens their connection to Chinese culture through a diverse repertoire
of traditional and contemporary dance forms. Through structured lessons
and performances, dancers develop not only technical skills and cultural
understanding, but also values such as discipline, resilience, and respect
for the arts.
<br>
<br>Members learn to express themselves creatively, using both body movements
and facial expressions to convey emotion and meaning in their performances.
They also explore choreography, dance appreciation, and critical response,
fostering holistic artistic growth.
<br>
<br>The CCA provides a platform for students to grow into confident leaders
and resilient learners, while at the same time emphasising teamwork and
commitment. Our dancers frequently represent the school in key events such
as the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (SYF AP), as well as
various school and community performances.</p>
