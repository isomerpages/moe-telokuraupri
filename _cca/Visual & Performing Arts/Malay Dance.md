<p>The TKPS Malay Dance CCA plays a vital role in preserving and promoting
the rich cultural heritage of the Malay community through the performing
arts. It provides students with a meaningful platform to develop grace,
rhythm, and discipline while deepening their appreciation for traditional
Malay dance forms.
<br>
<br>Through regular training and performances, members grow into confident,
resilient individuals who demonstrate teamwork, commitment, and care for
others.
<br>
<br>Our dancers are given numerous opportunities to shine on stage at school
events, cultural celebrations, and national showcases such as the Singapore
Youth Festival Arts Presentation (SYF AP), further enriching their learning
experience and cultural identity.</p>
