<p><strong>Values in Action (VIA)</strong> is central to developing our students'
civic literacy and cross-cultural understanding. Through meaningful community
engagement, our students learn to appreciate Singapore's diverse social
fabric while building their identity as active citizens who contribute
actively to society.</p>
<p>Our school's six-year VIA journey is thoughtfully structured to deepen
students' civic and cultural literacy. At Tier 1, all students participate
in level-wide projects that expose them to different community segments
and cultural traditions. These experiences help them understand various
perspectives and needs within our multicultural society.</p>

<p>At Tier 2, student leaders and CCA groups take greater ownership in planning
and implementing VIA projects, allowing them to develop deeper insights
into community issues while honing their leadership capabilities.</p>

<p><em>Through these VIA efforts, our students demonstrate compassion, responsibility and a strong belief in their ability to contribute meaningfully to society. These experiences not only deepen their understanding of community needs but also inspire them to be proactive and empathetic citizens.</em>
