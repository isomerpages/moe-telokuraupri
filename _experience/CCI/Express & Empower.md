<h4><strong>Celebrating Student Voice</strong></h4>
<p>The TKPS Talent Showcase is a celebration of student voice through music.
Featuring both vocal and instrumental performances, the showcase provides
a platform for students to express themselves with confidence, creativity
and heart. Whether singing a solo or performing in an ensemble, each student
brings their own story to life through sound.</p>
<p>More than just a performance, the showcase empowers students to take ownership
of their learning and growth. Through rehearsals and stage experiences,
they build resilience, develop stage presence and discover pride in their
progress. Every note played and every lyric sung is a reflection of their
commitment and courage.</p>
<p>At Telok Kurau Primary, we believe that when students are given space
to express, they find the strength to grow.</p>

<h4><strong>Play Like a PRO: Shaping Character Through Play</strong></h4>
<p>At our school, play is more than just fun—it’s a foundation for growth.
The <em>Play Like a PRO</em> programme (Play Responsibly with Others) is
thoughtfully designed for our Primary 5 and 6 students, blending responsibility,
joy and leadership into this unstructured play time.</p>
<p>Through strategy games like chess and foosball and active play such as
soccer and chapteh, students build social skills, resolve conflicts amicably
and take pride in caring for shared resources. Selected student Game Masters
take the lead, guiding their peers and learning the value of fair play
and responsibility.</p>
<p>This initiative fosters a safe, inclusive environment where every child
is empowered to lead, learn and play with purpose. Aligned with our school
values, <em>Play Like a PRO</em> cultivates respectful, resilient individuals—ready
for life, one recess at a time.</p>
