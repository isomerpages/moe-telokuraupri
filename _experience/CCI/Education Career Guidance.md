<p>Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is an integral part of developing
our students holistically. Our programme develops in them greater self-awareness
and self-directedness, empowering them to become lifelong learners who
make informed decisions about their future.</p>
<h4><strong>Curriculum lessons&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>ECG is introduced during Form Teacher Guidance Periods (FTGP) from Primary
3, where students begin to discover and develop their character strengths
by exploring new roles within their classes and Co-Curricular Activities
(CCAs).</p>
<p>In Primary 4, students are introduced to the 3 Key ECG questions of</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Who am I?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where do I want to go?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do I get there?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Using these questions as the basis, students learn to set specific, measurable,
achievable, realistic and timely (S.M.A.R.T) goals.</p>
<p>Students continue their process of self-discovery and exploration of their
education and career options on the MySkillsFuture Student Portal in Primary
5 and 6. Based on studentsâ€™ indicated interests, the portal recommends
potential career paths and occupations. Its game-like interface keeps students
engaged and interested throughout the exploration process.</p>
<h4><strong>Annual ECG Fair</strong></h4>
<p>In collaboration with cluster primary schools, an annual ECG is organised
to prepare Primary 6 students for the next stage of their education journey.
Secondary schools set up booths to showcase their niche programmes and
unique learning opportunities.</p>
