<p>At Telok Kurau Primary School, character development is at the heart of
our education. We strive to nurture students who understand what is right
and are empowered to act with integrity, resilience and care.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our school values—Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care
and Harmony—form the foundation of each student’s journey. Through Social
Emotional Learning (SEL) and intentional experiences in and beyond the
classroom, students internalise these values and apply them meaningfully.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A key platform for this is our Learning for Life Programme (LLP), Project
S.T.A.R., which leverages sports to develop students who are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Strong in Character</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Team-spirited in Action</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Active and Caring Citizens</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reflective, Resilient Learners</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From fundamental motor skills in the lower years to competitive sports
in the upper levels, students engage in age-appropriate physical activities
that build discipline, teamwork and emotional strength.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Programmes such as CCAs, inter-class games, sports day and structured
recess play ensure all students, regardless of ability, have opportunities
to participate, lead and grow. Talented student-athletes are also given
platforms to stretch their potential and take on leadership roles.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through sports, our students develop confidence, manage challenges, respect
differences and work towards shared goals. With every pass, goal and game,
they grow not just as athletes but as compassionate, future-ready individuals.</p>
