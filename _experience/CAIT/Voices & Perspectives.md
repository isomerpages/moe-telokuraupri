<p>Voices and Perspectives is a programme conducted during the CCE (Character
and Citizenship Education) periods in collaboration with the Mother Tongue
Department. It is designed to help our students connect what they read
to real-world issues, strengthening both their reading comprehension skills
and their understanding of the world they live in.</p>

<p>Through this programme, the students explore real-world topics such as
environmental sustainability, digital well-being, social cohesion and national
identity. These issues are discussed during guided reading and class discourse,
allowing them to deepen their understanding of current events and share
their perspectives with their classmates.</p>
<p>Voices and Perspectives aims to strengthen the studentsâ€™ sense of reality
and build key 21st Century Competencies, such as civic literacy and effective
communication. More than just reading, it allows students become thoughtful,
informed and participative members of society.</p>
