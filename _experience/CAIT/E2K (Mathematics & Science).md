<h4><strong>Excellence 2000 (E2K) Mathematics Programme</strong></h4>
<p>The school offers the E2K Mathematics Programme Singapore to P4 and P5
students. It is a Mathematics enrichment programme for students who demonstrate
interest and ability in Mathematics. It aims to develop in students’ mathematical
reasoning skills and deepen their conceptual understanding through an inquiry
approach.</p>
<p>Students will have opportunities to work independently or collaborate
with their peers and engage in mathematical thinking through resources
such as puzzles, games and mathematical explorations. The rich learning
experiences offered serve to help students to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions of a mathematician.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gain important 21st century competencies such as critical thinking, inventive
thinking and effective communication skills.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Teachers who have been trained in the E2K pedagogy run the programme.
The programme will take place over 15 weeks in Semester 1.</p>

<h4><strong>Excellence 2000 (E2K) Science Programme</strong></h4>
<p>Our school offers the&nbsp;E2K<strong> </strong>Science Programme&nbsp;to
selected primary 4 students. This is a science inquiry-based programme
aimed to stretch primary pupils who have demonstrated strong interest and
ability in science. It is adapted from Israel’s E2K Programme which is
developed by the Israel Centre for Excellence through Education (ICEE).
We have modified this enrichment programme to integrate technology where
teachers use e-pedagogy to create a more participatory, connected and reflective
classroom to nurture future-ready learners.</p>
<p>Through this E2K Programme, we hope that students will develop scientific
inquiry process skills, as well as nurture other important 21st century
competencies such as resilience and resourcefulness, critical and inventive
thinking, and effective communication skills.</p>
<p>Students will learn Science by going through the same process that scientists
use to generate knowledge in Science. Just as practising scientists make
mistakes in the real world, students are allowed to make mistakes in E2K
and teachers facilitate students to learn from the mistakes. Through collaborative
learning and guidance provided by the teacher, students practise scientific
thinking and reasoning, develop confidence and independence in carrying
out scientific inquiry as well as scientific habits, attitudes and dispositions.</p>
