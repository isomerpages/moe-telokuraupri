<h4><strong>Serve to Lead 2025: Nurturing Student Leaders with Heart and Purpose</strong></h4>
<p>At Telok Kurau Primary School, leadership is not about titles — it is
about influence, empathy and service. In line with this belief, the Serve
to Lead programme continues to provide authentic platforms for our Primary
4 and 5 student leaders to grow as confident and compassionate leaders
who make a difference in the lives of others.</p>
<p>Grounded in&nbsp;<em>The Leadership Challenge (TLC)</em>&nbsp;framework,
the programme empowers students to model exemplary leadership behaviours
such as inspiring a shared vision, enabling others to act and encouraging
the heart. Throughout the year, students took part in a series of carefully
designed sessions to develop both their leadership skills and character.</p>
<p>The journey began with the&nbsp;bonding and collaborative training session
where student leaders from Telok Kurau Primary School, Maha Bodhi School
and St. Anthony’s Canossian Primary School came together. This session
helped our student leaders connect with peers from other schools, understand
their responsibilities and explore what it truly means to lead with initiative.</p>
<p>Following this, the P4 and P5 leaders participated in the Active X Playdate,
a meaningful intergenerational experience supported by SportSG. During
this session, our P4 students interacted with seniors through modified
games designed to build connection and joy across generations. Meanwhile,
our P5 leaders guided seniors in decorating SG60 Pledge Cards, where heartfelt
wishes were penned in celebration of Singapore’s 60th birthday.&nbsp;These
moments of connection made the experience meaningful and memorable for
them.</p>
<p>In preparation for their next engagement, the student leaders took part
in the Dance of the Nation (DOTN) training. Here, they learnt to lead and
energise others — including the seniors — through movement, rhythm and
confidence. This session also reinforced the importance of communicating
with clarity and supporting others through encouragement.</p>

<p>The leadership journey culminates in the&nbsp;World Aquatics Learning
Journey, where student leaders will reunite with the same seniors they
had previously interacted with. During the session, our student leaders
had the honour of acting as young ambassadors, guiding and interacting
meaningfully with the seniors during the visit. This experience reminded
them that leadership is not just about taking charge — it is also about
listening, connecting, and making others feel seen and included.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through these various touchpoints, our student leaders have had the opportunity
to step out of their comfort zones, develop their leadership voice and
serve others with empathy. They have learnt to listen actively, lead with
heart and act with purpose.</p>
<p>The Serve to Lead programme is more than a series of events — it is a
journey of character, service and community. As our student leaders continue
to grow in their roles, we are confident that they will carry forward the
values of humility, courage and compassion.</p>
