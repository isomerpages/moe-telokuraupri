### **Student Care Centre**
#### **NASCANS@ Telok Kurau Student Care Centre**
NASCANS complements the school’s efforts to develop strong character values, competencies and mindsets in each student that are closely aligned with the school’s vision, mission and values, and MOE’s 21st Century Competencies framework. This is achieved through a combination of unique programmes such as Mind Maps which helps students organize thoughts and foster creative thinking, Habits in Action which helps students build resilience and self-regulation, and Impression ARTS which helps students develop positive character while exploring various art forms.
