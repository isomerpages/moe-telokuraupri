<h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
<p>To navigate the increasingly VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous)
world, leaders are needed in every domain. However, traditional definitions
of leadership as the domain of a few experts in positions of authority
no longer hold. At TKPS, we see leadership as a set of values, traits and
competencies that can be developed in every student. Student leadership
development at TKPS focuses on first growing the self-leadership dimension
to cultivate habits that lead to self-mastery and personal effectiveness.
This lays the foundation for the development of team leadership as the
student matures.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Beliefs &amp; Guiding Principles</strong></h4>
<p>In TKPS, every student is a leader. Therefore, the SLD programme is intentionally
designed to facilitate students to discover the leader within themselves.
Hence, the SLD philosophy in the following:</p>
<h5><strong>a. Every student can be developed as a leader</strong></h5>
<p>Every TKPS student possesses a unique blend of abilities, inclinations
and talents, and has the potential to be developed as a leader. He/She
is able to make a positive difference in his/her own right within his/her
sphere of influence, and be a leader. At the end of six years of primary
education, a TKPS student will discover his/her unique value as a leader.</p>
<h5><strong>b. Leadership development goes beyond developing the self, to impact those around us, the community and the world</strong></h5>
<p>Student leadership in TKPS entails having the confidence to take the initiative
to make a positive difference. All can and should proactively strive to
make a positive difference within one’s sphere of influence. Beyond the
self and the community, this will ultimately make a difference for Singapore.</p>
<h5><strong>c. Student Leadership Development is intentional</strong></h5>
<p>While incidental leadership learning can occur across all platforms, only
intentional student leadership development will ensure all students are
equipped with the requisite competencies for effective leadership. TKPS
is intentional about designing and delivering SLD programmes that provide
differentiated leadership development for students according to student
capacity and interest.</p>
<h4><strong>Student Leadership Development (SLD) Framework @ TKPS</strong></h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:75%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/studentleadership2.jpg">
</div>
<p>SLD Framework @TKPS is comprises three strategic focuses – leading self,
leading peers and leading teams. SLD@TKPS serves like a compass of values
which provides multiple avenues for students to explore their everyday
experiences, discover their strengths, test their limits, engage in reflection
and eventually develop their leadership skills from within. This process
enables student leaders to navigate and discover their true north that
leads them to the rainbow of true leadership. The rainbow represents a
spectrum of leadership competencies which students can develop and become
student leaders who can proactively strive to make a positive difference
within their sphere of influence. As a result, student leaders form the
pillars of the school. Ultimately, SLD@TKPS aims to develop student leaders
to be a&nbsp;<strong><em>TRUE</em></strong>&nbsp;leader who are able to&nbsp;<strong><em>T</em></strong> hink
critically,&nbsp;<strong><em>R</em></strong> eflect to develop greater <strong><em>U</em></strong> nderstanding
and <strong><em>E</em></strong> ncourage others to be active contributors.</p>
<h4><strong>Approach</strong></h4>
<p>SLD@TKPS uses The Leadership Challenge Model, developed by James M. Kouzes
and Barry Z. Posner. It approaches leadership as a set of learnable and
teachable behaviours, encapsulated by the Five Practices, Ten Commitment
of Exemplary Leadership and Thirty Leadership Practices Behaviour Statements.
SLD@TKPS will have progressive training to develop these leadership competencies
for students and different student leader segments.</p>
<h5><strong>Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership</strong></h5>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Model The Way</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inspired A Shared Vision</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Challenge The Process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable Others To Act</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage The Heart</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These behaviours are what leaders are consistently engaging in when they
are performing at their best and achieving extraordinary results. This
tool will enable TKPS student leaders to chart their own leadership journey
and hone their leadership competencies.</p>
