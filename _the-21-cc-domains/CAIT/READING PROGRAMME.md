<h4><strong>Reading for Life@TKPS</strong></h4>
<p>The <em>Reading for Life@TKPS</em> programme is designed to cultivate a
vibrant reading culture that supports our students’ journey as lifelong
learners. Through reading, students expand their knowledge and deepen their
understanding of the world around them. This programme offers a diverse
and engaging range of events and activities aimed at sparking curiosity
and fostering a love for reading. By introducing students to various genres
and literary forms, it encourages them to explore, imagine, and grow through
the power of books.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. Biweekly Scheduled Library Visits</strong>
</p>

</div>
<p>Students visit the school library every two weeks during scheduled sessions
to cultivate regular reading habits and a lasting love for books. These
sessions give students the opportunity to browse, borrow and explore a
wide selection of books from different genres.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The library visits support key reading initiatives such as the <em>Reading Passport</em>,
allowing students to choose books that contribute to their reading reflections
and reviews. These sessions not only encourage reading for pleasure but
also help students build confidence in selecting texts that match their
interests and reading levels.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>2. Reading Passport</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>The <em>Reading Passport</em> is one of the key activities under the <em>Reading for Life@TKPS</em> programme,
designed to nurture a strong reading habit among our students and encourage
them to explore a wide variety of literary genres.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inspired by the theme of World Exploration, the Reading Passport invites
students to embark on a reading journey across different "continents" by
borrowing books from the school library. After completing each book, students
will write a review in their Reading Passport and colour the corresponding
continent to represent their literary travels.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This activity aims to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>

<li>
<p>Encourage students to read widely across different genres</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strengthen reading comprehension and reflection skills</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>To reward consistent reading, students will receive a small token for
every three book reviews completed and submitted to their English teacher.</p>

<p><em>kidsREAD</em> is a reading programme that promotes the love of reading
and cultivates good reading habits among young learners aged 4 to 8 from
lower income families. At TKPS, parent volunteers conduct these sessions
to support this group of students.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Telok Kurau Primary School participates yearly in the <em>Read for Books</em> charity
book drive organised by the National Library Board. This meaningful initiative
promotes reading and encourages the sharing of books with the less privileged
in our community.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For every 10 people who read for at least 15 minutes, 1 book will be donated
to selected beneficiaries, with a national target of up to 3,190 books.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2025, students and staff at Telok Kurau Primary School supported the
initiative during their English Language reading and library periods in
Week 4 and Week 5. Each session lasted 30 minutes and was conducted in
the classroom or library as part of their regular schedule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With around 1,400 participants this year, the school has the potential
to contribute approximately 560 books. This annual effort not only supports
a good cause but also nurtures a love of reading and a spirit of giving
among our students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5. Extensive Reading</strong>
