<p>Our school offers the <strong>EXCELLENCE 2000 (E2K) SCIENCE PROGRAMME</strong> to
selected primary 4 students. This is a science inquiry-based programme
aimed to stretch primary pupils who have demonstrated strong interest and
ability in science. It is adapted from Israelâ€™s E2K Programme which is
developed by the Israel Centre for Excellence through Education (ICEE).
We have modified this enrichment programme to integrate technology where
teachers use e-pedagogy to create a more participatory, connected and reflective
classroom to nurture future-ready learners.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through this E2K Programme, we hope that pupils will develop scientific
inquiry process skills, as well as nurture other important 21st century
competencies such as resilience and resourcefulness, critical and inventive
thinking, and effective communication skills.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Pupils will learn Science by going through the same process that scientists
use to generate knowledge in Science. Just as practising scientists make
mistakes in the real world, pupils are allowed to make mistakes in E2K
and teachers facilitate pupils to learn from the mistakes. Through collaborative
learning and guidance provided by the teacher, pupils practise scientific
thinking and reasoning, develop confidence and independence in carrying
out scientific inquiry as well as scientific habits, attitudes and dispositions.</p>
