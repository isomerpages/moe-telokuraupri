<p>Do you know the school has a Rain Garden and a Butterfly Garden? The school’s
water learning trail aims to increase appreciation and awareness of water
as a precious resource by learning the story of Singapore Water through
various activities. The trail is facilitated by the school’s Green Ambassadors
and teachers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Students work in teams to find out how Singapore obtains its supply, and
will visit the school’s rain garden and rooftop garden to understand the
collection of rainwater runoff. Basic water quality tests are also introduced
to engage students in understanding the standards of potable water.</p>
