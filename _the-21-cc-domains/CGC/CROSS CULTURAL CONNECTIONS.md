<h4><u>School Visit - Hangzhou Gudang No.1 Elementary School (China)</u></h4>
<p>Telok Kurau Primary School was delighted to host a group of 15 students
and 4 teachers from Hangzhou Gudang No.1 Elementary School during their
recent visit to Singapore. As part of their immersion experience, the students
joined our Primary 5 classes for lessons in Math, Science, and English.
They were warmly welcomed by our Primary 5 students, who served as their
buddies throughout the visit. Through classroom activities and conversations,
both groups had the opportunity to learn more about each other’s countries,
school life, and cultures. It was a meaningful and memorable exchange that
fostered new friendships and broadened perspectives for everyone involved.</p>
