<p>At Telok Kurau Primary School, we believe in preparing our students not
only with academic knowledge but also with essential life skills for the
future. This year, our teachers from various disciplines came together
to design an exciting new interdisciplinary learning journey anchored in
the values of the <strong>21st Century Competencies (E21CC)</strong> framework.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Teachers from English, Science, Mathematics, Art, and Character &amp;
Citizenship Education worked collaboratively to co-plan a meaningful and
engaging learning experience that integrates subject knowledge with real-world
skills. By aligning their lesson objectives and activities, the team designed
a cohesive journey that nurtures <strong>critical thinking, communication, collaboration, creativity, and civic literacy</strong>—all
within authentic and relevant contexts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The process of planning this journey was a true reflection of the values
we aim to instill in our students. Teachers demonstrated <strong>teamwork, open-mindedness, and innovation</strong>,
holding regular cross-departmental discussions to brainstorm, refine, and
align their plans. Together, they crafted learning experiences that go
beyond the classroom—inviting students to explore complex issues from multiple
perspectives, work in teams to solve problems, and reflect on their roles
in a global community.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This interdisciplinary approach not only strengthens the connections between
different areas of learning but also allows students to see how knowledge
and values come together to make a difference in the real world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are proud of the dedication and passion our teachers have shown in
developing this learning journey, and we look forward to seeing how our
students grow through it—becoming confident individuals, self-directed
learners, and active contributors to society.</p>
