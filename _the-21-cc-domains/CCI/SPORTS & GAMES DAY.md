<h4><strong>Games Day @ TKPS</strong></h4>
<p>Games Day @ TKPS is a signature event designed to bring the entire school
community together in a spirit of celebration, camaraderie, and active
participation. Held in conjunction with Children’s Day, this joyful occasion
provides an opportunity for our students to celebrate together as one school.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The event is thoughtfully curated with the following objectives in mind:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>To Celebrate Children's Day as a School Community</strong>
<br>We mark Children’s Day with fun and meaningful activities that allow students
to feel valued, recognised, and appreciated in a vibrant and inclusive
school environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>To Strengthen Positive Peer Support Relationships (PSR) and Teacher-Student Relationships (TSR)</strong>
<br>Through shared experiences and collaborative gameplay, students bond with
their classmates and teachers, fostering mutual respect, empathy, and a
deeper sense of belonging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>To Provide Opportunities for Students to Demonstrate Fundamental Movement Skills</strong>
<br>Games Day is aligned with our Physical Education goals by allowing students
to apply age-appropriate movement skills in a fun, engaging context:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Primary 1 and 2</strong>: Class relay races focusing on key locomotor
and non-locomotor skills including dribbling, crawling, running, and jumping.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Primary 3</strong>: Introduction to athletics-based events that
involve running, throwing, and jumping to build coordination and body control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Primary 4 to 6</strong>: A carnival-style setup with game stations
requiring a range of manipulative and gross motor skills, such as throwing,
striking, shooting, and kicking.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>To Encourage Teamwork and Class Spirit</strong>
<br>Students work together to earn points for their classes by participating
enthusiastically and supporting one another during the games. This shared
goal promotes teamwork, responsibility, and a strong sense of class identity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Ultimately, Games Day @ TKPS is not only a platform for physical activity
and enjoyment but also a powerful vehicle for character development, relationship
building, and school pride.</p>
