<p>Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is an integral part of our holistic
education framework. Guided by MOE’s ECG objectives, our programme helps
students in developing greater self-awareness and self-directedness, empowering
them to become lifelong learners who can make informed decisions about
their future.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our aim is to nurture confident individuals who are curious about the
world of work and equipped with the knowledge of their own strengths, interests,
and aspirations.</p>
<h4><strong>Curriculum lessons&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>ECG is introduced during Form Teacher Guidance Periods (FTGP) from Primary
3, where students begin to discover and develop their character strengths
by exploring new roles within their classes and Co-Curricular Activities
(CCAs).</p>
<p></p>
<p>In Primary 4, students are introduced to the 3 Key ECG questions of</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Who am I?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where do I want to go?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do I get there?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Using these questions as the basis, students learn to set specific, measurable,
achievable, realistic and timely (S.M.A.R.T) goals.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Students continue their process of self-discovery and exploration of their
education and career options on the MySkillsFuture Student Portal in Primary
5 and 6. Based on students’ indicated interests, the portal recommends
potential career paths and occupations. Its game-like interface keeps students
engaged and interested throughout the exploration process.</p>
<h4><strong>ECG Fair</strong></h4>
<p>In 2024, our school hosted <strong>ECG Day</strong> with the theme <em>"Live Your Dreams"</em> to
prepare our graduating students for the next stage of their education journey.
Thirteen secondary schools set up booths to showcase their niche programmes
and unique learning opportunities. The event was also attended by students
from Changkat Primary, Damai Primary, and St. Anthony’s Canossian Primary,
enriching the experience through shared exploration.</p>
