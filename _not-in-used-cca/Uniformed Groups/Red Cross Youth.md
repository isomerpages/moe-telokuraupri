<h3><strong>Red Cross Youth</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Introduction of CCA</strong></h4>
<p>The Red Cross Youth is a CCA that teaches our members to strive and do
one’s best. It takes to cognizance the Red Cross ethos and service to humanity
as its focus. Our CCA combines character-building, leadership, essential
red-cross knowledge, life-saving skills, basic foot drills and local community
service in our programming. Link members will have opportunities to represent
the school at zonal and national events, competitions and camps organised
by SRCS HQ. We hope that as members go through our activities, they will
develop a keen sense of duty and community to serve with compassion.</p>
