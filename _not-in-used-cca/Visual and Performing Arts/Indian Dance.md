<h3><strong>Indian Dance</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Introduction of CCA</strong></h4>
<p>The schoolâ€™s Indian Dance CCA offers students a meaningful platform to
appreciate the rich aesthetics and traditions of Indian culture through
exposure to various Indian dance genres. Beginning with foundational steps,
members gradually progress to more intricate movements, while learning
key elements such as expressive facial techniques, coordinated hand and
footwork, graceful poise, and confident stage presence.
<br>
<br>Beyond dance skills, students develop a deeper appreciation for Indian
cultural practices and values. Through regular performances at school events
like the Prize-giving Day and national platforms such as the Singapore
Youth Festival Arts Presentation (SYF AP), members grow in self-confidence
and embody values of resilience, respect, and teamwork.</p>
