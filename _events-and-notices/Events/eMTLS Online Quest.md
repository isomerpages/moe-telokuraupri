### **e-MTLS Online Quest**
The Mother Tongue Languages Symposium is an annual event jointly organised by the Ministry of Education (MOE), the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL), the Malay Language Learning and Promotion Committee (MLLPC) and the Tamil Language Learning and Promotion Committee (TLLPC).

MTLS is going digital this year as e-Mother Tongue Languages Symposium (e-MTLS).

The e-MTLS Online Quest will go live on its digital platform, [www.mtls.edu.sg](http://www.mtls.edu.sg/)/others/online-quest, on 16 November. It features an interactive online task-based game for children between the ages of 4 to 9 to experience the joy of learning their Mother Tongue Language (MTL).

The game aims at developing your child’s listening and reading skills as he or she navigates different interactive tasks spanning different learning objectives such as knowledge on directions, food ingredients and numbers. Children will be exposed to a variety of words used in different settings to boost their MTL vocabulary.  

Parents are encouraged to join in the fun with their children. Take the opportunity to explore and pick up new words with your child while enjoying invaluable bonding time during this year-end school holidays.

Parents can also visit the e-MTLS website and discover creative ways to inspire your children to learn MTLs through videos endorsed by educational experts and explore innovative ideas in promoting the love for MTLs through exhibits put together by pre-schools, schools, community partners and the Ministry of Education (MOE).

A wide range of selected MTL digital and non-digital learning resources will be made available for sale on the website. You are cordially invited to browse the recommended picks and specially produced books by partner organisations at the online sales booth ([https://yuyi.com.sg/pages/mother-tongue-languages-symposium-mtls](https://yuyi.com.sg/pages/mother-tongue-languages-symposium-mtls)).
