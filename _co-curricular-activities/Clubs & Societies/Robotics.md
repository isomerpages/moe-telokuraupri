#### **Introduction of CCA**
The TKPS Robotics CCA is the core CCA in our Active Learning Programme (ALP). It provides the knowledge, skills and values to nurture our students interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Members work collaboratively in teams and are exposed to problem-solving skills and creative thinking as they participate in the design, construction and application of robots through various platforms such as SCRATCH, VEX, LEGO Mindstorms, and participate in various competitions such as IDE Competition, Singapore Vex Robotics Championships, First Lego League and DSO-DSTA Robotics Challenge.
