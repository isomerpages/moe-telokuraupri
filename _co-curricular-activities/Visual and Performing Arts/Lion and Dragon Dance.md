#### **Introduction of CCA**
The school's Lion and Dragon Dance troupe was formed in the year 2000 with the aim of providing members with knowledge, skills and values in the creating and performing of Lion Dance. In Chinese culture, the lion symbolizes strength, stability and superiority. However whilst the lions seem to be the most important part of lion dancing, it is the drumming and cymbals that bring the lions to life!  As part of the schoolâ€™s LLP, Lion Dance has always emphasised on development of character and excellence in its activities. Other than strength, stamina, flexibility and balance, it requires the ability to visualize and improvise dramatic movements. Our dedication during training has resulted in top honours in lion dance competitions over the years, and we have been featured on local media.
