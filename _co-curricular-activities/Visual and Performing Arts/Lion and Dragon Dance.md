#### **Introduction of CCA**
The Lion Dance CCA was formed in the year 2000. That year, the troupe had the honour to welcome the late founding Father of Singapore, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, with a Lion Dance performance when he visited the school. The Lion Dance Troupe has always emphasized excellence in its activities. Our dedication during training has resulted in top honours in lion dance competitions over the years, and we have been featured on local media. We have also been invited to perform at community events.
