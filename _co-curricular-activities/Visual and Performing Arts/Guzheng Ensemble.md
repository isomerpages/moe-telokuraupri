#### **Introduction of CCA**
The Guzheng Ensemble is an important CCA as our LLP, in cultivating a genuine love and a lifelong passion for music amongst its members. We aim to help them achieve mastery as they learn to play beautiful pieces of music! Since its establishment, the ensemble has embarked on the journey of musicianship, and its members have learnt the values of respect, resilience and excellence. Members are imbued with a strong sense of responsibility towards their guzheng by ensuring it is well tuned and put in their best during performances. They learn to work collaboratively as a team and play together as one. Members are given the opportunity to also perform at various school platforms as well as the SYF AP.
