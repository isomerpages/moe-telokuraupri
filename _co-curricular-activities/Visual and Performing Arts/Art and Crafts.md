<h3><strong>Art and Crafts</strong></h3><h4><strong>Introduction of CCA</strong></h4><p>The schoolâ€™s Art and Crafts CCA is an integral part of our LLP. It aims to nurture budding artists in the school by offering a variety of art forms for members to express their creativity and to hone their skills in the visual arts beyond the normal Art classroom. Members will learn about the 8 studio habits of art that will help them understand how an artist behaves and to become more competent student artists themselves. As such, members will learn to appreciate art, communicate visually and value the role of art in society. In doing the different art projects members are not just working independently but also collaboratively.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2023%20CCA/Art%20and%20Crafts2.jpg"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2023%20CCA/Art%20and%20Crafts3.jpg"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2023%20CCA/Art%20and%20Crafts4.jpg"></div><p></p>
