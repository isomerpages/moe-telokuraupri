### **Chinese Dance**

#### **Introduction of CCA**
The Chinese Dance CCA was established in 2001 to impart Chinese culture and appreciation of different ethnic practices. Through dance, we teach our students to be confident performers and learn the importance of teamwork and commitment. Students learn about the development of artistic expressions by conveying emotions using both body and facial expressions. Our dancers are given opportunities to be actively involved in school and public performances. We have been participating in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation and in 2018, attained the Certificate of Distinction.
