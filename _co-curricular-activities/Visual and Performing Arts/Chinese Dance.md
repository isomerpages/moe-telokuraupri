<h3><strong>Chinese Dance</strong></h3><h4><strong>Introduction of CCA</strong></h4><p>As our schoolâ€™s LLP focuses on character development through team sports and the arts, Chinese dance supports the aesthetic development of our students by allowing them to appreciate and connect with the Chinese culture through different forms of Chinese dance. This CCA provides our dancers with knowledge, skills and values through learning and performing Chinese Dance, as well as creating, appreciating and responding to dance. Through dance, we teach our members to be confident performers and learn the importance of teamwork and commitment. Our dancers learn about the development of artistic expressions by conveying emotions using both body and facial expressions. They are also given opportunities to be actively involved in school and public performances, such as the SYF AP.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/vpa2.jpg"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2023%20CCA/Chinese%20Dance.jpg"></div><p></p>
