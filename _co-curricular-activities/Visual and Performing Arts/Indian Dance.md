### **Indian Dance**

#### **Introduction of CCA**
Part of the school’s LLP, our Indian Dance Group provides the platform to appreciate the aesthetics of Indian culture and by exposing its members to different Indian Dance genre. Our dancers start off with basic dance steps before going on to more intricate moves. Elements of Indian dance facial expressions, hand and footwork, and poise and stage presence are also taught, as well as an appreciation of Indian cultural practices. Through opportunities to perform at different platforms such the schools’ SPG and SYF AP, members gain self-confidence and learn values such as resilience, respect and care as they perform together as a team.
