#### **Introduction of CCA**
Our Indian Dance group exposes students to different Indian Dance genres and provides a platform for them to showcase their talents. Through dance, we teach our students to be resilient and to have self-discipline. Our students have taken part in many external performances and in school events. We have been participating in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation and in 2018, attained the Certificate of Accomplishment.
