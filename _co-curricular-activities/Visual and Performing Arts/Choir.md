#### **Introduction of CCA**
The school’s Choir comprises an enthusiastic group of students and teachers who share a passion and appreciation for music and singing. As an important part of our school’s LLP, choir exposes our members to different genres, languages and cultures.  Through the practice sessions, members learn to develop their confidence and the importance of teamwork, as they sing together with one voice. By building a strong foundation in choral skills and techniques, they will be better prepared to pursue future vocal training and achieve even greater heights. Choir members are also given opportunities to perform on different occasions and platforms, such as the school’s Speech and Prize Giving (SPG) Day and the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (SYF AP).
