#### **Introduction of CCA**
Our Choir comprises an enthusiastic group of students and teachers who share a passion for music and singing. Through the practice sessions, members learn the values of resilience, responsibility and respect. The skills that are acquired include musicianship, teamwork, confidence and an appreciation for choral singing. Choir members are given opportunities to perform on different occasions. In the pursuit of choral excellence, they also took part in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation 2018 and obtained a Certificate Of Accomplishment.
