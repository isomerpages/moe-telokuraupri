#### **Introduction of CCA**
Our Malay Dance group aims to impart the rich cultural Malay heritage, and develop grace and discipline in students through the performing arts. Through dance, students are nurtured to become confident and resilient individuals, who are also active team players and caring citizens. We continue to strive for excellence and obtained the Certificate of Distinction in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation in 2018.
