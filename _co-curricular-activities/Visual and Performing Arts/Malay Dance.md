<h3><strong>Malay Dance</strong></h3><h4><strong>Introduction of CCA</strong></h4><p>Our TKPS Malay Dance group is an important part of our schoolâ€™s LLP. It plays an important role in imparting the rich cultural Malay heritage, and developing grace, rhythm and discipline in our dancers through the performing arts. Through our CCA, members are nurtured to become confident and resilient individuals, who are also active team players and caring citizens. Our Malay Dancers are also given opportunities to perform at different events such as school-based cultural celebrations and the SYF AP.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2023%20CCA/Malay%20Dance.jpg"></div><p></p>
