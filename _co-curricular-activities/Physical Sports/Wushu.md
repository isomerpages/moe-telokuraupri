<h3><strong>Wushu</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Introduction of CCA</strong></h4>
<p>Our TKPS Wushu team aims to promote the spirit of Wushu and emphasises
character building and inculcation of values in our members. Self-discipline
and resilience are essential values for learning the fundamentals of Wushu.
Students are also given opportunities to refine their skills and practice
sporting excellence by performing in school events and participating in
national competitions.</p>
