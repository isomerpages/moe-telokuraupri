Our TKPS Wushu team aims to promote the spirit of Wushu and emphasises character building and inculcation of values in our members. Self-discipline and resilience are essential values for learning the fundamentals of Wushu. Students are also given opportunities to refine their skills and practice sporting excellence by performing in school events and participating in national competitions.
