<h3><strong>Bowling</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Introduction of CCA</strong></h4>
<p>Bowling is a newly formed CCA at TKPS. It is a skill-based sport that
has a focus on hand-eye coordination and targeting skills, and at the same
time building muscular strength, flexibility, balance and coordination.
It develops a growth mindset and develops mental resiliency. Members will
learn the basics of bowling such as holding and releasing the ball, footwork,
and practising different throw techniques. At the same time, they will
acquire values such as perseverance and teamwork. <strong>This CCA requires members to stay for afternoon practices.</strong>
