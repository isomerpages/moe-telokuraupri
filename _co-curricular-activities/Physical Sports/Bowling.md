#### **Introduction of CCA**
Bowling is a newly formed CCA at TKPS. It is a skill-based sport that has a focus on hand-eye coordination and targeting skills, and at the same time building muscular strength, flexibility, balance and coordination. It develops a growth mindset and develops mental resiliency. Members will learn the basics of bowling such as holding and releasing the ball, footwork, and practising different throw techniques. At the same time, they will acquire values such as perseverance and teamwork. **This CCA requires members to stay for afternoon practices.**
