<h3><strong>Football</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Introduction of CCA</strong></h4>
<p>Football is a popular sport that is offered to both girls and boys. These
young talents are taught the essential techniques of playing the game and
introduced to positions and roles in football. As one of team sports in
the schoolâ€™s LLPs, football develops our members to have good character.
Whether during training sessions or competitions, these platforms serve
as opportunities for them to learn about resilience, respect, teamwork
and discipline.</p>
