Wushu or Chinese Martial Arts is made up of the words 武 and 术. 武, means “martial” or “military” and 术 translates into “discipline”, “skill” or “method”. The TKPS Wushu team emphasizes character building and inculcation of values in our members. Self-discipline and resilience are essential values for learning the fundamentals of Wushu. Students are also given opportunities to refine their skills by performing in school events and participating in national competitions.
