#### **Introduction of CCA**
TKPS Basketball CCA aims to develop a passion in our boys and girls in learning to play basketball well. Our focus is not just on developing sound fundamental skills and team strategies, but on building strong character. As one of our team sports in our **Learning for Life Programme (LLP) – “Character Development Through Team Sports and the Arts”**, the CCA instils in our members the belief in “playing right, playing well”, through strong partnership with our teachers, coaches and parents in teaching of values such as resilience, teamwork and sportsmanship. It has achieved numerous successes over the years at various inter-zonal and national basketball competitions and will continue to do so in the years to come.
