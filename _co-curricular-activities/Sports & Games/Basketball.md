#### **Introduction of CCA**
Basketball has always been a strength in Telok Kurau Primary School. We have established ourselves as a school that develops players who are sound in fundamental skills with strong character. The team have clinched several national titles in competitive inter-school categories throughout the years.  
  
Many of our players have applied for Direct School Admission (DSA) successfully and continue to excel in secondary schools. Everyone in the basketball fraternity is like a family â€“ once a TKPS Basketballer, always a TKPS Basketballer!
