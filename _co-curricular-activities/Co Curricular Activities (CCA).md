#### **Vision**
Character and Confidence Actualization

#### **Mission**
To implement a well-structured co-curricular programme which encourages mass participation in Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) as well as discover and develop talents.

#### **CCAs@TKPS**

CCAs are an integral part of the holistic development and learning experiences for our students. It allows them to discover their interests and talents; and develop CCA-specific knowledge, skills and values. Through authentic and experiential learning, CCAs provide excellent platforms for the development of values, social-emotional (SE) competencies and 21st Century Competencies (21CC).

The merger of Telok Kurau Primary (TKPS) and Eunos Primary (EPS) in 2023 puts us in a better position to offer a more diverse yet balanced options for our students. We have thus curated a list of 18 CCAs which are forward-looking, relevant and will cater to their interests and needs. 

With these 4 physical sports, 3 uniformed groups, 7 visual and performing arts, and 4 clubs and societies CCA options,  students will get to discover their passion, build friendships, cultivate leadership skills and acquire values such as teamwork and resilience in a vibrant environment. 

#### **CCAs@TKPS Policy**

1. All P3 to P6 students will have a CCA.   
2. We believe that sufficient time and space is needed in order of students to develop the skills and competencies related to the CCA. The students will remain in their CCAs for the duration of their primary school years from Primary 4 to build the essential skills and competencies.    
3. CCAs are conducted within the curriculum time on Wednesdays, 7.45 a.m. to 9.15 a.m. Additional CCA trainings for selected CCAs will take place on Tuesdays and/or Thursdays, 4.00 p.m. to 5.30 p.m. Teachers-in-charge of these CCAs will contact the parent(s)/guardian directly to inform them of the details.  
4. Students who demonstrate excellence in CCA are eligible to be nominated for leadership positions, as well as the Edusave Awards for Achievement, Good Leadership and Service (EAGLES), provided they satisfy the eligibility criteria.

####  **CCAs@TKPS Workflow for Recruitment/Transfer**

1. New CCAs are opened only to 2023 P3 and P4 students.
2. In consideration of the merger in 2023, the recruitment of CCA members will be opened to the 2023 Primary 3 cohort and a transfer exercise for the 2023 Primary 4 cohort in Term 1 2023.
3. Students will indicate their top three CCA choices in rank order. If there is no choice/single choice exercised, the school will then make the final decision in allocating a CCA. After the deadline, the CCA teachers, together with the CCA Committee, will allocate students to the respective CCAs.Â 
4. Trials will also be conducted for selected CCAs. Students who apply for these CCAs will need to fulfill the conditions in order to be considered for final selection. Table 1 indicates the CCAs that require trials (#).
