<img src="/images/cca2.jpg" style="width:75%">

CCA is an integral part of the holistic development of a TKPS student. It allows students to discover their interests and talents; and develop CCA-specific knowledge, skills and values. Through authentic and experiential learning, CCA provides excellent platforms for the development of values, social-emotional (SE) competencies and 21st Century Competencies (21CC) in students.

1\. All Primary Three to Primary Six students will be allocated a CCA from their top three choices.   

2\. CCA will take place on Wednesdays, 7.30am to 9am. Selected students will be required to attend additional sessions after school hours.   

3\. Students are to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance per term, failing which their place in the CCA will be forfeited.   

4\. Students should remain committed to a CCA for at least a year. Any request for change of CCA are to be submitted during the CCA Transfer Window, in Term 2 Week 7 and Term 2 Week 8.   

5\. Application for a second CCA will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Students may apply for a second CCA only if: 

	a. they have good attendance records in the current CCA;
	b. they are able to meet academic deadlines and maintain quality in assignments; 
	c. the CCA timings do not clash.   

6\. All Primary 4 to Primary 6 students who demonstrate excellence in CCA are eligible to be nominated for leadership positions, as well as the Edusave Awards for Achievement, Good Leadership and Service (EAGLES), provided they satisfy the eligibility criteria.
