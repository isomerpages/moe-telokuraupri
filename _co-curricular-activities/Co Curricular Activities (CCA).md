<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>Character and Confidence Actualisation</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>To implement a well-structured co-curricular programme which encourages
mass participation in Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) as well as discover
and develop talents.</p>
<h4><strong>CCAs@TKPS</strong></h4>
<p>CCAs are an integral part of the holistic development and learning experiences
for our students. It allows them to discover their interests and talents;
and develop CCA-specific knowledge, skills and values. Through authentic
and experiential learning, CCAs provide excellent platforms for the development
of values, social-emotional (SE) competencies and 21st Century Competencies
(21CC).</p>
<p>At TKPS, we have 18 CCAs which are forward-looking and caters to the varied
needs and interests of our students.</p>
<p>With our diverse yet balanced offering of 4 Physical Sports (PS), 3 Uniformed
Groups (UG), 7 Visual and Performing Arts (VPA), and 4 Clubs And Societies
(CS) CCA options, students will get to discover their passion, build friendships,
cultivate leadership skills and acquire values such as teamwork and resilience
in a vibrant environment.</p>

<h4><strong>CCAs@TKPS Policy</strong></h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>All P3 to P6 students will have a CCA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We believe that sufficient time and space is needed in order of students
to develop the skills and competencies related to the CCA. The students
will remain in their CCAs for the duration of their primary school years
from Primary 4 to build the essential skills and competencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CCAs are conducted within the curriculum time on Wednesdays, 7.45 a.m.
to 9.15 a.m. Additional CCA trainings for selected CCAs will take place
on Tuesdays and/or Thursdays, 4.00 p.m. to 5.30 p.m. Teachers-in-charge
of these CCAs will contact the parent(s)/guardian directly to inform them
of the details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who demonstrate excellence in CCA are eligible to be nominated
for leadership positions, as well as the Edusave Awards for Achievement,
Good Leadership and Service (EAGLES), provided they satisfy the eligibility
criteria.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>CCAs@TKPS Workflow for Recruitment/Transfer</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The recruitment of CCA members will be opened to the <strong>2025 Primary 3</strong> cohort
and a transfer exercise will be opened to the <strong>2025 Primary 4 cohort</strong> in <strong>Term 1 2025</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students will <strong>indicate their top three CCA choices in rank order</strong>.
If there is no choice/single choice exercised, the school will then make
the final decision in allocating a CCA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are membership caps for selected CCAs. Students who apply for these
CCAs will need to fulfill the conditions in order to be considered for
final selection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
