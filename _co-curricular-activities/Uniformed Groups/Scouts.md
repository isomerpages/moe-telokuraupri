### **Scouts**

#### **Introduction of CCA**
Cub Scouts are guided by the Scout Promise and Scout Laws. We believe that Scouting encourages the physical, mental, spiritual and social development of our cub scouts, with an emphasis on duty to country and helping other people. Our members gather weekly in unit meetings for training, activities, songs and games. They are groomed in skills to attain proficiency and progress badges. Cub scouts who show leadership potential will undergo further grooming via district camps as well as leadership programmes to further hone their leadership abilities.
