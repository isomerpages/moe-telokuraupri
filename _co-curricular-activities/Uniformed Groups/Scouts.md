#### **Introduction of CCA**
Our Cub Scouts are guided by the Scout Promise and Scout Laws. We believe that Scouting encourages the physical, mental, spiritual and social development of our students, with an emphasis on duty to God, duty to country and helping other people. Our Scouts gather weekly in unit meetings for training, activities, songs and games. They are groomed in skills to attain proficiency and progress badges. We achieved Silver for the Frank Cooper Sands Award in 2018.
