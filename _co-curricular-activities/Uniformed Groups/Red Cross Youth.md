#### **Introduction of CCA**
The Red Cross Youth is a CCA that teaches our members to strive and do oneâ€™s best. It takes to cognizance the Red Cross ethos and service to humanity as its focus.  Our CCA combines character-building, leadership, essential red-cross knowledge, life-saving skills, basic foot drills and local community service in our programming. Link members will have opportunities to represent the school at zonal and national events, competitions and camps organised by SRCS HQ. We hope that as members go through our activities, they will develop a keen sense of duty and community to serve with compassion.
