### **Brownies**

#### **Introduction of CCA**
The Brownies programme aims to develop our girls to their fullest potential as responsible citizens of the world. They are engaged in activities such as singing, craftwork, indoor and outdoor games, simple cooking and sewing. Brownies also learn about helping others which ties in with their motto â€“ Lend A Hand. These activities are planned and carried out with the objectives of developing leadership skills, team spirit and instilling social values in them. We take part in World Thinking Day and Brownies Cookies Project.
