<h4><strong>21st Century Competencies (21CC) Domains in Singapore's Education Framework<br></strong></h4>
<p>In today's rapidly evolving global landscape, our students need more than
just academic knowledge to thrive. The 21st Century Competencies (21CC)
framework was developed by the Ministry of Education (MOE) Singapore to
equip our students with the necessary competencies to be confident, self-directed
learners and active contributors to society.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The framework aims to prepare students for the challenges and opportunities
in an increasingly complex and interconnected world. It focuses on developing
both cognitive and non-cognitive skills that will enable students to navigate
future challenges, work effectively with others, and become responsible
citizens.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The 21CC Framework consists of 3 core domains:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Civic Literacy, Global Awareness and Cross-Cultural Skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Critical and Inventive Thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>These domains are underpinned by core values that form the foundation
of character development: Respect, Responsibility, Integrity, Care, Resilience,
and Harmony.</p>
