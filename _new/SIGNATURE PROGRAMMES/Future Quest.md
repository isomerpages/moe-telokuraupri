<h4>Primary 2 – Joyful Discoverers Club</h4>
<p>Our youngest explorers set off on a vibrant journey of discovery as part
of their FutureQuest adventure! At the Sea Aquarium, students dive deep
into the wonders of marine life and share about their favourite sea creatures.
They then embark on a cultural exchange, exploring the traditions and lifestyles
of two ASEAN countries and expressing their learning through thoughtful
postcards. Their quest ends with a culinary adventure as they uncover the
origins of roti prata, learn to follow a recipe, and take pride in making
their own! These experiences nurture their curiosity, creativity, and confidence
in expressing ideas—hallmarks of E21CC learning.</p>
<h4>Primary 4 – Making Purposeful Connections</h4>
<p>In this immersive FutureQuest experience, our Primary 4 students become
purposeful connectors as they journey through science, culture, and sustainability.
They begin by exploring the concepts of light and shadows through the art
of shadow puppetry, applying scientific understanding in creative ways.
Next, they delve into ASEAN cultures, developing cross-cultural awareness
and communication skills. Their adventure culminates in a hands-on aquaponics
project, where they grow their own greens and plan a meal using their harvest
to cook for their family. Through each task, students build on collaboration,
critical thinking, and a deeper understanding of purposeful living.</p>
<h4>Primary 6 – Future World Guardians</h4>
<p>As Future World Guardians, our Primary 6 students take on real-world challenges
with the spirit of service and innovation. They begin by researching pressing
environmental issues and produce compelling short videos to advocate for
change, using their voice to influence others. Next, they delve into food
sustainability—planning a nutritious week’s grocery list for a family on
a fixed budget, and curating a thoughtful food donation basket for those
in need. Through this, they gain a deeper appreciation of the cost of living
and the importance of empathy and wise resource management. Their final
mission launches them into the world of aerodynamics, where they design
and test a bottle rocket using mathematics and science. Throughout this
journey, they grow as proactive, future-ready leaders who strive and serve
with purpose.</p>
