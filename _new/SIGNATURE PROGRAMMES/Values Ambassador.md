<p>The Values Ambassador Programme is a form of recognition for students
who have exemplified our school values with unwavering dedication. Symbolised
by specially chosen animals and thoughtfully designed by Mr Mark Chang,
each collar pin carries the spirit of the value it represents.</p>
<p>Aspiring to earn all six collar pins with each representing one school
value, every student is empowered to strive for excellence and contribute
positively to our school community.</p>
