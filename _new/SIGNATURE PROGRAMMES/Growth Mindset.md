<p>We at TKPS hold to the belief that every child can grow and thrive to
become Confident Learners and Resilient Learners. Being equipped with a
growth mindset helps our students understand that their abilities and intelligence
are not fixed traits, but can be developed through effort, good strategies,
and persistence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through specially curated lessons and activities, students understand
that mistakes and setbacks are valuable opportunities to reflect, improve,
and succeed. This mindset empowers our students to take ownership of their
learning, overcome challenges with confidence, and develop the character
and grit to pursue their goals.</p>
