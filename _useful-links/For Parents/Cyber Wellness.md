Dear Parents / Guardians<br>
During Assembly (P1 – P4 on 30 Jan while P5 & 6 on 6 Feb), the students have pledged to uphold the following cyber wellness principles as an Internet user:<br>
* Respect for Self and Others
* Safe and Responsible Use, and 
* Positive Peer Influence.

They have also pledged to adopt the Sense-Think-Act process:
Sense the risks of harmful behaviours online.
Think and reflect on the issues presented online.
Act to protect and keep ourselves safe online and report any harmful or dangerous online behaviours or activities to a trusted adult or authority.

Please also engage your child / ward at home on cyber wellness using the following three sets of resources provided by MOE Cyber Wellness Team::<br>
* Parent Guide – 5 Tips to Ensure Your Child Stays Safe & Happy Online 
* Student Kit for Cyber Wellness and Learning with a Learning Device
* The Age of Digital Parenting

There is also a recently published Schoolbag article – 13 and ready for social media… or not?
