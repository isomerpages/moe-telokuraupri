It transforms childrenâ€™s learning experience by making them become the story characters in real-time and letting them produce videos to tell their stories.</p><p>Through the Moo-O Learning Cycle, children are supported in their learning and then through the spelling games and the videos they produce, the children demonstrate the language skills they have acquired. Moo-O is suitable for 5 to 9 year-olds and is ideal to be used in schools and homes.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Student%20Portals/MooO/MooO-1.jpg"></div><p><br></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Student%20Portals/MooO/MooO-2.jpg"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Student%20Portals/MooO/MooO-3.jpg"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Student%20Portals/MooO/MooO-4.jpg"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Student%20Portals/MooO/MooO-5.jpg"></div><p></p>
