<h4><strong>Harmony in Diversity: Learning the World Through Music</strong></h4>
<p>At Telok Kurau Primary School, music serves as a bridge that connects
people, cultures and communities. Through our cultural music programme,
students engage with musical traditions from Singapore and beyond, including
local ethnic sounds such as Teochew opera and Malay kompang, as well as
music from Asian, Western and Oceanic cultures. These experiences offer
insights into the stories, values and expressions of diverse communities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As students listen, create and perform, they explore how music reflects
identity and tradition. They learn to appreciate different cultural perspectives,
approach unfamiliar practices with curiosity, and express themselves with
empathy and confidence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These encounters deepen musical understanding while nurturing collaboration,
communication and respect. By learning through music, our students grow
into thoughtful and open-minded individuals, ready to contribute meaningfully
in an increasingly diverse and interconnected world.</p>
