#### What is Moo-O?

Moo-O is an app that provides children a meaningful, engaging and fun way to master their language skills, with special focus on reading fluency and speaking skills. It transforms childrenâ€™s learning experience by making them become the story characters in real-time and letting them produce videos to tell their stories. 

Through the Moo-O Learning Cycle, children are supported in their learning and then through the spelling games and the videos they produce, the children demonstrate the language skills they have acquired. Moo-O is suitable for 5 to 9 year-olds and is ideal to be used in schools and homes.
