<p>A group of our Primary 5 students embarked on a meaningful and exciting
overseas immersion trip to Kuching, Sarawak last week to deepen their cross-cultural
understanding, global awareness and to grow as joyful and curious learners.
Through the immersive experiences, school exchanges and cultural discovery,
they explored the rich heritage and vibrant life of Sarawak.</p>
