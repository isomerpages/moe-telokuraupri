<p>At TKPS, we believe that a physically educated student is one who is developed
holistically—physically, mentally, emotionally, and socially—and is well-prepared
to thrive in a fast-changing, interconnected world.</p>

<p>Our Physical Education Programme is closely aligned with the Ministry
of Education (MOE)’s Physical Education Curriculum Framework and aims to
equip students with the knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and skills needed
to engage in a wide variety of physical activities throughout their lives.
We promote a lifestyle of healthful living, encouraging students to participate
actively, responsibly, and respectfully.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The core values of Care, Harmony, Integrity, Resilience, Respect, and
Responsibility form the foundation of our PE curriculum. These values are
intentionally integrated into the PE experience, guiding students’ character
development and fostering essential social-emotional competencies across
five key domains.</p>
