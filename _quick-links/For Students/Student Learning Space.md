#### What is SLS?
The SLS is MOE's core platform for teaching and learning and is one of MOE’s key initiatives to transform the learning experiences of Singaporean students through the purposeful use of technology to enable students to engage in different learning modes.

#### The Future of SLS
SLS will continue to evolve to support MOE’s key priorities and serve the needs of our users. Over the next few years, SLS will be enhanced to provide more personalised, adaptive and self-directed learning experiences for our students. Teachers and students will also benefit from wider access to quality learning resources and apps.
